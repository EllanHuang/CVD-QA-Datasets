    "C": "LDH-4 > LDH-5",
    "D": "LDH-5 > LDH-4",
    "answer": "A",
    "exp": "When LDH-1 is greater than LDH-2, it is referred to as flipped LDH and is indicative of MI. LDH-1 isoenzyme is found primarily in hea muscle and is lesser in concentration than the LDH-2 Isoenzyme which is primarily found in RBC. When the concentration of LDH-1 is observed to be greater than LDH2. It is referred to as flipped LDH and is indicative of Myocardial infarction. LDH has five isoenzymes: LDH-1 LDH-1 is found primarily in hea muscle 17% to 27% LDH-2 LDH-2 is primarily found in Red blood cells 27% to 37% LDH-3 LDH-3 is highest in the lung 18% to 25% LDH-4 LDH-4 is highest in the kidney, placenta, and pancreas 3% to 8% LDH-5 LDH-5 is highest in the liver and skeletal muscle 0% to 5% The LDH test helps determine the location of tissue damage. Thus in Normal ratios LDH-1 is less than LDH-2 and LDH-5 is less than LDH-4. When LDH-1 is greater than LDH-2: It is referred to as flipped LDH. It is indicative of MI. When your LDH-5 is greater than your LDH-4: It could mean damage to the liver or liver disease. This includes cirrhosis and hepatitis. Ref: Harrisons 19th edition"

    "A": "antral stenosis",
    "B": "Tricuspid regurgitation",
    "C": "Aoic stenosis",
    "D": "Aoic regurgitation",
    "answer": "C",
    "exp": "Even severe AS may exist for many years without producing any symptoms because of the ability of the hyperophied LV to generate the elevated intraventricular pressures required to maintain a normal stroke volume. Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasing obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decades. Exeional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

    "answer": "C",
    "exp": "In the absence of peritoneal signs, angiography is the diagnostic test of choice for acute mesenteric ischemia. Patients with peritoneal signs should undergo emergent laparotomy. Acute mesenteric ischemia may be difficult to diagnose. The condition should be suspected in patients with either systemic manifestations of aeriosclerotic vascular disease or low cardiac-output states associated with a sudden development of abdominal pain that is out of propoion to the physical findings. Because of the risk of progression to small-bowel infarction, acute mesenteric ischemia is an emergency and timely diagnosis is essential. Although patients may have lactic acidosis or leukocytosis, these are late findings. Abdominal films are generally unhelpful and may show a nonspecific ileus pattern. Since the pathology involves the small bowel, a barium enema is not indicated. Upper gastrointestinal series and ultrasonography are also of limited value. CT scanning is a good initial test, but should still be followed by angiography in a patient with clinically suspected acute mesenteric ischemia, even in the absence of findings on the CT scan. In addition to establishing the diagnosis in this stable patient, angiography may also assist with operative planning and elucidation of the etiology of the acute mesenteric ischemia. The cause may be embolic occlusion or thrombosis of the superior mesenteric aery, primary mesenteric venous occlusion, or nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia secondary to low-cardiac output states. A moality of 50% to 75% is repoed. The majority of affected patients are at high operative risk, but early diagnosis followed by revascularization or resectional surgery or both are the only hope for survival. Celiotomy must be performed once the diagnosis of aerial occlusion or bowel infarction has been made. Initial treatment of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia includes measures to increase cardiac output and blood pressure. Laparotomy should be performed if peritoneal signs develop"

    "C": "Very broad QRS complexes",
    "D": "Response to carotid sinus massage",
    "answer": "C",
    "exp": "Ventricular tachycardia can be classified based on its morphology: Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia means that the appearance of all the beats match each other in each lead of a surface electrocardiogram (ECG). Scar-related monomorphic ventricular tachycardia is the most common type and a frequent cause of death in patients having survived a hea attack, especially if they have weak hea muscle. RVOT tachycardia is a type of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia originating in the right ventricular outflow tract. RVOT morphology refers to the characteristic pattern of this type of tachycardia on an ECG. The source of the re-entry circuit can be identified by evaluating the morphology of the QRS complex in the V1 lead of a surface ECG. If the R wave is dominant (consistent with a right bundle branch block morphology), this indicates the origin of the VT is the left ventricle. Conversely, if the S wave is dominant (consistent with a left bundle branch block morphology, this is consistent with VT originating from the right ventricle or interventricular septum. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, on the other hand, has beat-to-beat variations in morphology. This may appear as a cyclical progressive change in cardiac axis, previously referred to by its French name torsades de pointes (\"twisting of the spikes\"). However, at the current time, the term torsades de pointes is reserved for polymorphic VT occurring in the context of a prolonged resting QT interval. Another way to classify ventricular tachycardias is the duration of the episodes: Three or more beats in a row on an ECG that originate from the ventricle at a rate of more than 120 beats per minute constitute a ventricular tachycardia Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1423"

Although exercise stress testing is an appropriate method for evaluating a patient's cardiac function preoperatively, this patient's functional status is limited by his peripheral vascular disease and therefore a pharmacologic stress test would be the preferred method of cardiac evaluation. An ECG should be performed in this patient with a history of cardiovascular disease, hypeension, and diabetes, but a normal ECG would not preclude fuher workup.

Dooo- needle time should be \u0005 30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK ; maintain aPTTT at 1.5-2.0 control (\u000150-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists \u000190 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI. Later coronary angiography after fibrinolysis generally reserved for pts with recurrent angina or positive stress test. The initial management of NSTEMI (non-Q MI) is different . In paicular, fibrinolytic therapy should not be Additional Standard Treatment (Whether or not reperfusion therapy is undeaken): * Hospitalize in CCU with continuous ECG monitoring. * IV line for emergency arrhythmia treatment. * Pain control: (1) Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg IV q5-10min until pain is relieved or side effects develop ; (2) nitroglycerin 0.3 mg SL if systolic bp \u0001 100 mmHg; for refractory pain: IV nitroglycerin (begin at 10 g/min, titrate upward to maximum of 200 g/min, monitoring bp closely); do not administer nitrates within 24 h of sildenafil or within 48 h of tadalafil (used for erectile dysfunction); (3) -adrenergic antagonists * Oxygen 2-4 L/min by nasal cannula (maintain O2 saturation \u0001 90%). * Mild sedation (e.g., diazepam 5 mg PO qid). * Soft diet and stool softeners (e.g., docusate sodium 100-200 mg/d). * -Adrenergic blockers reduce myocardial O2 consumption, limit infarct size, and reduce moality. Especially useful in pts with hypeension, tachycardia, or persistent ischemic pain; contraindications include active CHF, systolic bp \u0005 95 mmHg, hea rate \u0005 50 beats/min, AV block,or history of bronchospasm. Administer IV (e.g., metoprolol 5 mg q5-10min to total dose of 15 mg), followed by PO regimen (e.g., metoprolol 25-100 mg bid). * Anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents: Pts who receive fibrinolytic therapy are begun on heparin and aspirin as indicated above. In absence of fibrinolytic therapy, administer aspirin, 160-325 mg qd, and low-dose heparin (5000 U SC q12h for DVT prevention). Full-dose IV heparin (PTT 2 control) or low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h) followed by oral anticoagulants is recommended for pts with severe CHF, presence of ventricular thrombus by echocardiogram, or large dyskinetic region in anterior MI. Oral anticoagulants are continued for 3 to 6 months, then replaced by aspirin. * ACE inhibitors reduce moality in pts following acute MI and should be prescribed within 24 h of hospitalization for pts with STEMI--e.g., captopril (6.25 mg PO test dose) advanced to 50 mg PO tid. ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely after discharge in pts with CHF or those with asymptomatic LV dysfunction ; if ACE inhibitor intolerant, use angiotensin receptor blocker (e.g., valsaan or candesaan). * Serum magnesium level should be measured and repleted if necessary to reduce risk of arrhythmias."

Dooo- needle time should be \u0005 30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK ; maintain aPTTT at 1.5-2.0 \u0007 control (\u000150-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists \u000190 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI. Later coronary angiography after fibrinolysis generally reserved for pts with recurrent angina or positive stress test. The initial management of NSTEMI (non-Q MI) is different . In paicular, fibrinolytic therapy should not be administered."

    "answer": "C",
    "exp": "Tolerance to organic nitrates may develop in a few days or less, depending on the dose and frequency of administration. Continuous exposure to nitroglycerin through use of a transdermal skin patch has frequently caused nitrate tolerance. A daily 10-to-14-hour drug-free period will prevent nitrate tolerance. Nitrate tolerance is a cellular tolerance caused by depletion of sulfhydryl groups required for receptor signal transduction. The drug-free interval allows time for these groups to replenish before the next period of drug exposure. Nitrates are metabolized by hepatic nitroreductase, and there is neither evidence of cytochrome P 450 involvement nor of induction of this enzyme by drugs. Although the patient's symptoms could be caused by increased physical activity or onset of vasospasm, these are less likely causes in a patient with continuous nitroglycerin exposure. Vasospasm is also unlikely because the episodes occurred during exeion. Ref - Harrison's principles of internal medicine 20e pg427,1860 / researchgate.net"

H. influenzae is a rare cause. Clinical features: In Ludwig's angina, there is usually cellulitis of the tissue rather than frank abscess. Marked difficulty in swallowing (odynophagia). Varying degrees of trisumus. On involvement of sublingual space, floor of the mouth is swollen, edematous and tongue seems to be pushed up and back. On involvement of the submaxillary space, the submental and submandibular regions become swollen and tender and impa woody-hard feel.Tongue is progressively pushed upward and backward threatening the airway. Laryngeal edema may appear, if it spreads to parapharyngeal or retropharyngeal space. Treatment: Systemic antibiotics I and D should be postponed as long as possible because pus is seldom found. Tracheostomy is required if airway is endangered. If incision and drainage for Ludwig's angina is done under GA-there are increased chances of aspiration and shock as tongue is pushed up and back in Ludwig angina."

Numerous small emboli may obstruct most of the pulmonary circulation resulting in acute\nright heart failure. Another mechanism is by release of vasoconstrictor substances from platelets or by reflex\nvasoconstriction of pulmonary vessels.\niii) Pulmonary infarction. Obstruction of relatively smallsized pulmonary arterial branches may result in pulmonary\ninfarction . The clinical features include chest pain due to fibrinous pleuritis, haemoptysis and dyspnoea due\nto reduced functioning pulmonary parenchyma.\niv) Pulmonary haemorrhage. Obstruction of terminal branches (endarteries) leads to central pulmonary\nhaemorrhage. The clinical features are haemoptysis, dyspnoea, and less commonly, chest pain due to central\nlocation of pulmonary haemorrhage. Sometimes, there may be concomitant pulmonary infarction.\nv) Resolution. Vast majority of small pulmonary emboli (60-80%) are resolved by fibrinolytic activity.

Dooo- needle time should be \u0005 30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK ; maintain aPTTT at 1.5-2.0 control (\u000150-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists \u000190 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI. Later coronary angiography after fibrinolysis generally reserved for pts with recurrent angina or positive stress test. The initial management of NSTEMI (non-Q MI) is different . In paicular, fibrinolytic therapy should not be Additional Standard Treatment (Whether or not reperfusion therapy is undeaken): * Hospitalize in CCU with continuous ECG monitoring. * IV line for emergency arrhythmia treatment. * Pain control: (1) Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg IV q5-10min until pain is relieved or side effects develop ; (2) nitroglycerin 0.3 mg SL if systolic bp \u0001 100 mmHg; for refractory pain: IV nitroglycerin (begin at 10 g/min, titrate upward to maximum of 200 g/min, monitoring bp closely); do not administer nitrates within 24 h of sildenafil or within 48 h of tadalafil (used for erectile dysfunction); (3) -adrenergic antagonists * Oxygen 2-4 L/min by nasal cannula (maintain O2 saturation \u0001 90%). * Mild sedation (e.g., diazepam 5 mg PO qid). * Soft diet and stool softeners (e.g., docusate sodium 100-200 mg/d). * -Adrenergic blockers reduce myocardial O2 consumption, limit infarct size, and reduce moality. Especially useful in pts with hypeension, tachycardia, or persistent ischemic pain; contraindications include active CHF, systolic bp \u0005 95 mmHg, hea rate \u0005 50 beats/min, AV block,or history of bronchospasm. Administer IV (e.g., metoprolol 5 mg q5-10min to total dose of 15 mg), followed by PO regimen (e.g., metoprolol 25-100 mg bid). * Anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents: Pts who receive fibrinolytic therapy are begun on heparin and aspirin as indicated above. In absence of fibrinolytic therapy, administer aspirin, 160-325 mg qd, and low-dose heparin (5000 U SC q12h for DVT prevention). Full-dose IV heparin (PTT 2 control) or low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h) followed by oral anticoagulants is recommended for pts with severe CHF, presence of ventricular thrombus by echocardiogram, or large dyskinetic region in anterior MI. Oral anticoagulants are continued for 3 to 6 months, then replaced by aspirin. * ACE inhibitors reduce moality in pts following acute MI and should be prescribed within 24 h of hospitalization for pts with STEMI--e.g., captopril (6.25 mg PO test dose) advanced to 50 mg PO tid. ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely after discharge in pts with CHF or those with asymptomatic LV dysfunction ; if ACE inhibitor intolerant, use angiotensin receptor blocker (e.g., valsaan or candesaan). * Serum magnesium level should be measured and repleted if necessary to reduce risk of arrhythmias."

    "D": "All of the above",
    "answer": "D",

Tissue injury releases a characteristic pattern of LDH isoenzymes that can be separated by electrophoresis.The blood test most commonly used to confirm the existence of hea muscle damage is the creatine kinase/CK. CK-MB shows an increase above normal in a person's blood test about six hours after the sta of a hea attack.It reaches its peak level in about 24 hours and returns to normal in 48 to 72 hours. The peak level and the return to normal can be delayed in a person who's had a large hea attack, especially if they don't get early and aggressive treatment. Tests can measure the level of other cardiac muscle proteins called troponins specifically troponin T (cTnT) and troponin I (cTnI). These proteins control the interactions between actin and myosin, which contracts or squeezes the hea muscle. Troponins specific to hea muscle have been found, allowing the development of blood tests (assays) that can detect minor hea muscle injury (\"microinfarction\") not detected by CK-MB. Normally the level of cTnT and cTnI in the blood is very low. It increases substantially within several hours (on average four to six hours) of muscle damage. It peaks at 10 to 24 hours and can be detected for up to 10 to 14 days."

The best initial test to diagnose hereditary hematochromatosis are Transferrin saturation and unsaturated Iron binding capacity As transferrin saturation is not provided amongst the options, Iron binding capacity is the single best answer of choice. Note Serum ferritin levels are a good index of body iron stores and are raised early during the cause of disease. Yet serum ferritin levels should not he used as initial screening test to detect hereditary hematochromatosis. This is because serum ferritin also acts as an acute phase reactant and its levels are increased in variable infections and inflammatory conditions without iron overload.

    "D": "Any of the above",
    "answer": "B",
    "exp": "Ans. B. Restrictive. (Ref. Robbins Basic Pathology 8th/ Table 11-5).Restrictive cardiomyopathy results in a stiff, noncompliant myocardium and can be due to depositions (e.g., amyloidosis and hemochromatosis), increased interstitial fibrosis (e.g., caused by irradiation), or to endomyocardial scarring. Myocarditis results from muscle injury caused by an inflammatory process that may be secondary to infections or immune reactions. Coxsackieviruses A and B are the most common causes in the U.S. Clinically, myocarditis may be asymptomatic, give rise to acute heart failure, or evolve into dilated cardiomyopathy.Cardiomyopathy is a term applied to intrinsic disease of the cardiac muscle; there may be specific causes, or it may be idiopathic. There are three general pathophysiologic categories of cardiomyopathy: dilated (90%), hypertrophic, and restrictive (least common). Dilated cardiomyopathy results in systolic (contractile) dysfunction. It may be acquired, for example, following myocarditis, toxic exposures (e.g., alcohol), or pregnancy (peripartum). In 25% to 35% of cases genetic defects in cytoskeletal proteins are causal. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy results in diastolic (relaxation) dysfunction. The vast majority of cases are due to autosomal dominant mutations in the genes encoding the contractile apparatus, in particular ?-myosin heavy chain.

Because of the wall thinning that accompanies dilation, the ventricular thickness may be less than, equal to, or greater than normal. Mural thrombi are common and may be a source of thromboemboli. By definition there is no primary valve pathology. Microscopically most myocytes are hypertrophied with enlarged nuclei, but many are attenuated, stretched, and irregular. There is variable interstitial and endocardial fibrosis.# The essential gross feature of HCM is massive myocardial hypertrophy without ventricular dilation. The classic pattern of HCM involves disproportionate thickening of the ventricular septum relative to the left ventricle free wall (so-called asymmetrical septal hypertrophy). On longitudinal sectioning, the ventricular cavity loses its usual round- to-ovoid shape and \"banana-like\" configuration. The characteristic histologic features in HCM are severe myocyte hypertrophy, myocyte (and myofiber) disarray, and interstitial and replacement fibrosis.# In idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy the ventricles are of approximately normal size or slightly enlarged, the cavities are not dilated, and the myocardium is firm. Biatrial dilation is commonly observed. Microscopically there is interstitial fibrosis, varying from minimal and patchy to extensive and diffuse. Restrictive cardiomyopathy of disparate causes may have similar gross morphology. However, endomyocardial biopsy can reveal disease-specific features (e.g., amyloid, iron overload, sarcoid granulomas)."

Beta blockers are considered first-line agents, as they can slow down the hea rate and decrease the likelihood of ectopic beats. For people who cannot tolerate beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil can be used, but are potentially harmful in people who also have low blood pressure or severe shoness of breath at rest. These medications also decrease the hea rate, though their use in people with severe outflow obstruction, elevated pulmonary aery wedge pressure, and low blood pressures should be done with caution. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be avoided in people with evidence of obstruction. For people whose symptoms are not relieved by the above treatments, disopyramide can be considered for fuher symptom relief. Diuretics can be considered for people with evidence of fluid overload, though cautiously used in those with evidence of obstruction. People who continue to have symptoms despite drug therapy can consider more invasive therapies.

Past medical history is significant for a myocardial infarction three years ago. The patient takes aspirin daily. Vital signs are normal.

The cardiac examination reveals an S4 hea sound. The most likely cause of this unilateral blindness is which of the following?",

    "B": "Cavernous sinus thrombosis",
    "C": "Posterior cerebral aery occlusion",
    "D": "Retinal aery occlusion",
    "answer": "D",
    "exp": "This patient has a sudden onset of complete, unilateral, painless loss of vision with intact extraocular muscle movement. This is consistent with occlusion of the retinal aery. The retina derives its blood supply from the internal carotid aery the ophthalmic aery, from which branch the central retinal aery and ciliary aeries. The central retinal aery supplies the inner layers of retina, while ciliary aeries supply blood to the choriocapillaris and the outer retinal layers. Occlusion of small retinal aerioles produces \"cotton wool\" spots while total occlusion of the ophthalmic aery leads to total ischemia and blindness. This usually occurs secondary to atherosclerotic disease. The key here is recognizing that the loss of vision is an isolated finding with no other neurologic symptoms. Other deficits would be consistent with a stroke of a larger vascular territory such as the internal carotid aery. Carotid aery dissection is less likely than retinal aery occlusion because there would likely be multiple associated neurologic findings in the case of dissection, as the internal carotid aery supplies a large poion of the anterior circulation of the brain. The most likely symptoms among a large cadre of possibilities is face and arm weakness contralateral to the dissection. Cavernous sinus thrombosis would lead to facial pain and possible cranial nerve deficits. The optic nerve (cranial nerve II) extends anteriorly from the optic chiasm through the superior orbital fissure. Posterior cerebral aery occlusion is less likely than retinal aery occlusion because there would likely be multiple associated neurologic findings. Also, the visual field loss resulting from a unilateral posterior cerebral aery occlusion would more likely be a homonymous hemianopia, it would not cause complete blindness in one eye. Other changes that may occur from posterior cerebral aery stroke are complex findings, such as the inability of recognize faces (prosopagnosia), failure to connect visual perception with conscious thought, color vision loss, and difficulty with reading (dyslexia or alexia). Memory problems and motor impairment are also common associated findings."

It increases effective refractory period-ERP (Le refractoriness) of A-V node by direct, vagomimetic and antiadrenergic action - the minimum interval between consecutive impulses that can successfully traverse the conducting tissue is increased. 2. A degree of A-V block is naturally established in AF. Because of the relatively long ERP of A-V node, many atrial impulses impinge on it while it is still refractory; others falling early in the relative refractory period get extinguished by decremental conduction - These concealed impulses leave upper margin ofA-V node refractory for a fuher period. Thus, any influence which increases atrial rate in AF (e.g. digitalis), by itself reduces ventricular rate. o Inhibition of Na+ K+ ATPase is responsible for inotropic action of digitalis, not for antiarrhythmic action. o Digitalis has two impoant pharmacological actions - I. Increased contractility of hea by inhibiting Na+ ATPase This action is beneficial in cardiac failure. 2. Increased refractoriness of SA node and AV node .1 automaticity and conduction This action is beneficial in arrhythmia."

Hypehyroidism should always be considered with new-onset atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation in which the rapid ventricular response is difficult to control.

He receives a high dosage of a cephalosporin antibiotic during the next 10 days. He now has increasing fatigue. On physical examination, he has tachycardia and scleral icterus. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, platelet count of 261,000/ mm3, and total WBC count of 8300/ mm3. The direct Coombs test is positive. The peripheral blood smear shows reticulocytosis. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his anemia?",
    "A": "Dietary nutrient deficiency",
    "B": "Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy",
    "C": "Immune-mediated hemolysis",
    "D": "Infection with parvovirus",
    "answer": "C",
    "exp": "Drug-induced hemolytic anemias are neither common nor severe enough to be recognized since the hemolysis is mainly extravascular. However, many patients receive drugs, so the potential for a drug reaction exists, and this immune-mediated mechanism must be distinguished from other causes for anemia. Cephalosporins are the most frequent drugs implicated. Treatment consists of cessation of therapy with the drug because most cases are due to drug-dependent antibody formation. Nutrient deficiencies reduce marrow production, so reticulocytosis is unlikely. DIC is unlikely with a normal platelet count. Parvovirus infection may suppress erythropoiesis transiently in individuals with normal red cells but may precipitate an aplastic crisis in those with a hemoglobinopathy. Persons with abnormal red cells are likely to have a history of anemia. Hemoglobinopathies are not Coombs positive."

Subcutaneous administration of low-molecular-weight heparin (such as enoxaparin) is an alternative. There is no role for digoxin, as this may increase myocardial oxygen consumption and exacerbate the situation. Thrombolytic therapy is reserved for the treatment, typically within 6 h, of ECG-documented myocardial infarction and does not reduce cardiac events in the setting of unstable angina.

Thromboxane A2 , produced by platelets, promotes platelet aggregation when clotting is required, and inhibition of thromboxane A2 synthesis by aspirin reduces the potential for inappropriate clot formation, and further heart attacks. Thromboxane A2 is produced from arachidonic acid by the action of COX, the enzyme covalently modified and irreversibly inhibited by aspirin. Leukotrienes are also synthesized from arachidonic acid, but utilize lipoxygenase in their synthesis, which is not inhibited by aspirin. Cholesterol, triglyceride, and cytokine synthesis do not require COX activity."

    "exp": "Echocardiography is an invaluable tool for assessing cardiovascular function in both normal and disease states. In the case of atrial fibrillation (AF), a chronic course versus an acute and self-limited course poend completely different treatment strategies and long-term prognoses. The most common cause of chronic AF is valvular disease, followed by congestive hea failure (CHF). The most common anatomic correlate seen in patients with AF (Framingham Hea Study) is an enlarged left atrium. A dilated left ventricle is commonly seen with both CHF and AF. However, an enlarged left atrium is more closely correlated with chronic AF than is left ventricular dilation. The causal relationship between an enlarged left atrium and AF is unclear. A dilated right ventricle is commonly seen in severe right hea failure (RHF). The most common cause of RHF is left hea failure (LHF). There is no consistent relationship between right hea size and the presence of AF. A hyperophied ventricular septum is commonly seen in hypeensive hea disease or idiopathic hyperophic aoic stenosis. Chronic AF in these patients, however, is much less common. Ref: Prystowsky E.N., Padanilam B.J., Waldo A.L. (2011). Chapter 40. Atrial Fibrillation, Atrial Flutter, and Atrial Tachycardia. In V.

The inhalation route provides very rapid absorption and, like the sublingual route, avoids the hepatic first-pass effect. Because of its unpleasant odor and extremely sho duration of action, amyl nitrite is now obsolete for angina. Amyl nitrite is a highly volatile liquid. It is available in fragile glass ampules packaged in a protective cloth covering.Ampule has to be crushed with fingers, and the vapors have to be inhaled through protective covering.

    "D": "Low dose aspirin (81 mg/d)",
    "answer": "C",
    "exp": "Malignancy is a recognized risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), and VTE is the second leading cause of death in cancer patients. Procoagulant molecules expressed both by cancer cells and host tissue contribute to this condition. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the preferred anticoagulant for long-term treatment in patients with cancer. When compared with warfarin, LMWH reduces the rate of recurrent VTE without significant risk of bleeding. Newer anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban have not been adequately tested for cancer-induced VTE yet.Young patients with unprovoked VTE, a history of unexplained VTE, or family history of VTE raise the suspicion of an inherited hypercoagulable disorder. The common inherited hypercoagulable disorders are Factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, protein S deficiency, protein C deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, dysfibrinogenemia, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. When inherited hypercoagulable disorders are strongly suspected, tests for above mentioned disorders can be ordered. In the event of an acute thrombosis, however, it is not recommended to test for protein C, protein S, and anti-thrombin III since active coagulation can reduce the plasma concentration of these proteins resulting in false-positive result. To avoid confusion, it is recommended to order only Factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, and antiphospholipid antibody with acute VTE or when patients are on warfarin.Warfarin-induced skin necrosis results from a transient hypercoagulable state. Warfarin initially affects all the vitamin K-dependent clotting proteins (Factors II, VII, IX, X, and proteins C and S). Since Protein C has a short half-life (8-12 hours), the serum protein C concentration drops quickly to 50% of normal in first 24 hours. Since circulating levels of other vitamin K-dependent proteins are still high, this gives rise to a hypercoagulable state which may cause microthrombi in the dermal and subcutaneous vessels, resulting in skin necrosis. The risk is particularly high in case of congenital protein C deficiency; nearly one-third cases of warfarin-induced skin necrosis are associated with congenital protein C deficiency."

The venous A wave represents atrial contraction and disappears due to the absence of an atrial beat. Decreased filling of the hea results in a decrease in stroke volume.

Distinctive Pathophvsiological features include: Heterogeneous hyperophy of LV Pattern of hyperophy is distinctive Asymmetrical septa! hyperophy is characteristic mainly affecting the IV septum and anterolateral wall Thickness of ventricular septum is dispropoionately increased when compared with the free wall Dynamic LV outflow obstruction The LV outflow obstruction is dynamic i.e. it is related to narrowing of the subaoic area as a consequence of opposition of anterior mitral valve leaflet against the hyperophied septum in midsystole. The concept is termed systolic anterior motion (SAM) of mitral valve. The obstruction in HOCM is dynamic and is caused by the opposition of mitral valve leaflet against the hyperophied septum during systole. Increase in volume of blood in LV will move the muscular obstruction away from the opposite wall and decrease the obstructing agent as well as the intensity of murmur. Passive leg raising augments venous return, increases the volume of blood in LV, decreases the obstruction and hence decreases the murmur. Increase in myocardial contractility worsens the obstruction by moving the opposing walls closer to each other. 13 agonists (increase myocardial contractility) would thus increase the obstruction and should not be used. 13 blockers on the other hand are the agent of choice as these decrease myocardial contractility and hence relieve the obstruction by moving the opposing walls away from each other.

At 1 hour after ischemia, there is no morphologic change indicative of necrosis. The first signs of necrosis appear 12 hours after irreversible ischemia: myocytes appear intensely eosinophilic and wavy, but there is no inflammatory reaction yet. Acute inflammatory cells (neutrophils) infiltrate the infarcted area beginning 1 day and peaking at approximately 2-3 days after injury. This acute inflammatory response paially overlaps with the subsequent influx of lymphocytes and histiocytes. Reabsorption of necrotic myofibers by histiocytes, as well as proliferation of small blood vessels, marks early formation of granulation tissue at around 5 days.

CK-MB isoenzyme is more specific for MI but may also be elevated with myocarditis or after electrical cardioversion. Total CK (but not CK-MB) rises (two- to threefold) after IM injection, vigorous exercise, or other skeletal muscle trauma. A ratio of CK-MB mass:CK activity \u0003 2.5 suggests acute MI. CK-MB peaks earlier (about 8 h) following acute reperfusion therapy . Cardiac-specific troponin T and troponin I are highly specific for myocardial injury and are the preferred biochemical markers for diagnosis of acute MI. They remain elevated for 7-10 days. Serum cardiac markers should be measured at presentation, 6-9 h later, then at 12-24 h. NONINVASIVE IMAGING TECHNIQUES Useful when diagnosis of MI is not clear. Echocardiography detects infarct-associated regional wall motion abnormalities (but cannot distinguish acute MI from a previous myocardial scar).

    "question": "A 73-year-old man with history of hypertension and osteoarthritis is evaluated for gradually increasing dyspnea over the preceding 6 weeks. He takes metoprolol for hypertension and naproxen for the arthritis. He has occasionally awakened in the night with mild dyspnea relieved by sitting up but has not noticed edema. Physical examination shows BP of 148/94, HR 96, and RR 16. O2 saturation is 92%. Neck veins show the jugular column 7 cm above the sternal angle. Lung examination reveals mild basilar crackles but no wheezing. Cardiac examination shows sustained apex impulse, S4 gallop, and no murmur. There is no peripheral edema. ECG shows stable left ventricular hypertrophy; no Q waves are seen. Chest x-ray shows increased interstitial markings and some cephalization of flow to the upper lobe vessels. The cardiac silhouette is boot-shaped, but there is no definite cardiomegaly. Echocardiogram shows left ventricular hypertrophy and LV ejection fraction of 55% (normal 50%-70%). What is the likely pathogenesis of this patient's dyspnea?",
    "A": "Increased metabolic demands leading to high-output heart failure (HF)",
    "B": "Occult coronary artery disease with dyspnea as an angina equivalent",
    "C": "Impaired diastolic relaxation and filling",
    "D": "Interstitial lung disease (ILD) mimicking pulmonary vascular congestion",
    "answer": "C",
    "exp": "The most likely explanation for this patient's presentation is heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF), also known as diastolic dysfunction. As many as 50% of patients presenting with definite HF (Heart failure) will have an ejection fraction above 50%. HFPEF is more common in the elderly, in women, and those with conditions (especially hypertension) that lead to LV hypertrophy. Often the echocardiogram will show evidence of impaired relaxation or increased stiffness of the LV (the latter often suggested by decreased flow across the MV during atrial systole, giving the so-called reversed e/a flow ratio). Tachycardia, by decreasing diastolic filling time, will often worsen HF symptoms in diastolic dysfunction. As opposed to systolic HF, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have not demonstrated long-term survival benefit. Management focuses on controlling BP, preventing tachycardia, and treating pulmonary and peripheral fluid overload with diuretics; so many of the modalities used in systolic HF are also employed in HFPEF, just without proof of survival benefit.High output HF due to an AV fistula, Paget disease, or hyperthyroidism can mimic diastolic HF, but the patient usually has evidence of a hyperdynamic circulation (tachycardia, wide pulse pressure, hyperdynamic precordium). Occult CAD should be considered in patients with exertional dyspnea (which can be an angina equivalent), but this patient's rest symptoms and pulmonary vascular congestion would be unusual. In HF due to coronary artery disease, there is almost always evidence of prior MI or ischemic change on ECG. Nevertheless, a stress test is often obtained in patients with unexplained HF to rule out this possibility. Interstitial lung disease can cause rales and interstitial changes on CXR but would not explain the cephalization of flow nor the elevated venous pressure. Measuring B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) will resolve the issue in equivocal cases; BNP will be elevated in HF and normal or minimally elevated in ILD. Anemia can cause fatigue and exertional dyspnea and, rarely, even overt HF, but to cause HF the anemia would have to be very severe (usually Hb 7 g/dL or below) and should be apparent from the physical examination. In addition, severe anemia would usually cause evidence of hyperdynamic circulation as seen in high-output HF."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with a history of intravenous drug abuse is admitted to a hospital for rapidly progressive malaise, fever, and chills. On physical examination, subungual splinter hemorrhages and a systolic murmur are detected. Blood cultures are positive for Staphylococcus aureus. She died of myocardial infarction on her third hospital day. Which of the following was the underlying condition leading to the patient's demise?",
    "A": "Acute infective endocarditis",
    "B": "Carcinoid hea disease",
    "C": "Libman-Sacks endocarditis",
    "D": "Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis",
    "answer": "A",
    "exp": "Infective endocarditis leads to formation of bulky and friable vegetations on the valvular leaflets. The vegetations are composed of fibrin, neutrophils, and colonies of bacteria that cause erosion of underlying cardiac structures. Fragments of infected vegetations may detach and cause pulmonary or systemic septic embolism. Splinter hemorrhages in the nail bed and petechiae in skin and mucosae are also due to microscopic septic emboli. In this case, myocardial infarction was probably due to a septic embolus in the coronary circulation. If infective endocarditis is due to a virulent organism such as Staphylococcus aureus (a common cause of endocarditis in intravenous drug abusers), a tumultuous clinical course ensues, associated with high moality. With less virulent organisms, such as Streptococci viridans, Subacute infective endocarditis is the resultant clinical picture. Subacute endocarditis arises in patients with previously malformed or damaged valves and is associated with a slower course and a better prognosis. Also Know: Carcinoid hea disease is caused by serotonin-producing carcinoids in the liver or lungs. Fibrosis of the endocardium ensues, affecting the right hea in the case of hepatic carcinoids and the left hea for pulmonary carcinoids. Thickening and rigidity of valvular leaflets are characteristic gross findings. Libman-Sacks endocarditis is a non-infective form of endocarditis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The vegetations are small and regularly aligned along the valvular margins. Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis was previously known as marantic endocarditis, being associated with debilitating conditions such as disseminated neoplasms. Increased coagulability is probably the underlying pathogenesis. The lesions are small vegetations similar to Libman-Sacks endocarditis.

Trismus (difficulty in the opening mouth). When infection is localized to sublingual space, structures in the floor of the month are swollen and tongue seems to be pushed up and back When the infection spreads to submaxillary space, the submental and submandibular regions become swollen and tender with woody hard feeling. Complications Airway obstruction due to laryngeal oedema, or swelling and push back of the tongue. Spread of infection to parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal spaces and thence to the mediastinum. Aspiration pneumonia. Septicemia. Treatment Consists of giving high doses of broad-spectrum antibiotics, combined with metronidazole to combat the anaerobes immediately until the results of cultures and sensitivity tests are available.

Individual Education2. Mass Education- Primordial Level is Best level of prevention for Non-communicable diseases* Primary Level of Prevention:- It is the action taken prior to onset of disease, which removes the possibility that a disease will ever occur- Modes of Intervention:1. Health Promotion: Is targeted at strengthening the host through a variety of approaches/interventions, e.g. Health Education, Environmental modifications, Nutritional interventions, Lifestyle and behavioral changes2. Specific Protection: Is targeting the prevention of disease through a specific intervention- Primary level of prevention is applied when 'risk factors are present, but disease has not yet taken place'- It signifies 'intervention in the Pre-pathogenesis Phase of a disease/ health problem'* Secondary Level of Prevention:- It halts the progress of disease at its' incipient stage and prevents complications- Modes of Intervention:1. Early Diagnosis: Detection of disturbances while biochemical, functional and morphological changes are still reversible or prior to occurrence of manifest signs and symptoms2. Treatment: Shortens period of communicability, reduces mortality and prevents occurrence of further cases (secondary cases) or any long-term disability- Secondary level of prevention is applied when disease has possibly set in: It attempts to arrest the disease process, seek unrecognized disease and treat it before irreversibility and reverse communicability of infectious diseases- National Health Programs by Govt, of India mostly operate at Secondary level of prevention- Secondary prevention is an imperfect tool in control of transmission of disease: It is more expensive and less effective than primary prevention- It is an important level of prevention for diseases like Tuberculosis, Leprosy and STDs* Tertiary Level of Prevention:- Is applied when disease has advanced beyond early stages: It aims to reduce or limit impairments and disabilities, minimize suffering caused by existing departures from good health- Modes of Intervention:1. Disability Limitation: It 'prevents the transition of disease from impairment to handicap'2. Rehabilitation: Training and retraining of an individual to the highest possible level of functional ability; It can be medical, vocational, social or psychological- Tertiary level of prevention signifies 'intervention in late pathogenesis phase'ALSO REMEMBER* All Vaccines (including Anti-rabies vaccine): Specific Protection mode of intervention, Primary Level of prevention* Screening is predominantly Secondary Level of Prevention with some component of Primary Prevention also"

    "answer": "B",
    "exp": "Dissecting aneurysms are usually the result of cystic medial necrosis of the aoa. This abnormality results from loss of elastic tissue in the media and is associated with hypeension and Marfan's syndrome. Most cases of dissecting aneurysms involve a transverse tear in the intima and are located in the ascending aoa, just above the aoic ring. The pain caused by a dissecting aneurysm is similar to the pain caused by a myocardial infarction, but it extends into the abdomen as the dissection progresses. Additionally, the blood pressure is not decreased with a dissecting aneurysm unless the aoa itself has ruptured. In contrast, berry aneurysms, found at the bifurcation of aeries in the circle of Willis, are due to congenital defects in the vascular wall. Rupture of these aneurysms may produce a fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Berry aneurysms have been noted in about one-sixth of patients with adult polycystic renal disease and account for death in about 10% of patients with this type of polycystic renal disease. Syphilitic (luetic) aneurysms occur in the thoracic aoa and may lead to luetic hea disease by producing insufficiency of the aoic valve. Mycotic (infectious) aneurysms result from microbial infection during septicemia, usually secondary to bacterial endocarditis. They are prone to rupture and hemorrhage. The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a group of eight syndromes characterized by defects in collagen synthesis. In EDS IV there is deficient synthesis of type III collagen and a tendency to rupture of muscular aeries, including dissecting aneurysms of the aoa."

    "exp": "Ludwig angina is a type of bacterial infection that occurs in the floor of the mouth, under the tongue. It often develops after an infection of the roots of the teeth (such as tooth abscess) or a mouth injury. This condition is uncommon in children. CLinical features: There is marked difficulty in swallowing (odynophagia) with varying degrees of trismus. When infection is localized to the sublingual space, structures in the floor of mouth are swollen and tongue seems to be pushed up and back. When infection spreads to submaxillary space, submental and submandibular regions become swollen and tender, and impa woody-hard feel. Usually, there is cellulitis of the tissues rather than frank abscess. Tongue is progressively pushed upwards and backwards threatening the airway. Laryngeal oedema may appear. Complications: 1.Spread of infection to parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal spaces and thence to the mediastinum. 2. Airway obstruction due to laryngeal oedema, or swelling and pushing back of the tongue. 3.Septicaemia. 4.Aspiration pneumonia. Ref - otolaryngology Dhingra 6E p263"

    "B": "Increased blood ketone bodies",
    "C": "Decreased creatinine in the urine",
    "D": "Decreased blood lactate",
    "answer": "A",
    "exp": "Tissues contain characteristic isozymes or mixtures of isozymes. Enzymes, such as lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase (CK), differ from one tissue to another. Lactate dehydrogenase contains four subunits. Each subunit may be either of the heart (H) or the muscle (M) type. Five isozymes exist (HHHH, HHHM, HHMM, HMMM, and MMMM). CK contains two subunits. Each subunit may be either of the muscle (M) or the brain (B) type. Three isozymes exist (MM, MB, and BB). The MB fraction is most prevalent in heart muscle.Troponin I is found in large amounts in muscle cells. When a tissue is damaged, cellular enzymes leak into the blood. Heart muscle will release cardiac troponin I into the blood in response to a heart attack. In the absence of insulin, a person with type 1 DM will behave metabolically like a person undergoing prolonged starvation, except that blood glucose levels will be elevated. Lipolysis in adipose tissue will produce fatty acids, which will be converted to ketone bodies in the liver if the diabetes is left untreated. Because the blood glucose levels are also elevated, the brain continues to use glucose as a fuel, and the ketone bodies accumulate in the blood. Hepatitis and chronic alcoholism damage the liver, which would interfere with the urea cycle, leading to decreased BUN and increased ammonia in the circulation. Renal failure would display reduced creatinine in the urine and elevated creatinine in the blood."

    "B": "Decreased compliance of the heart",
    "C": "Increased left atrial pressure",
    "D": "Improvement of patient’s condition with administration of a positive inotropic agent",
    "answer": "D",
    "exp": "Diastolic dysfunction is an impairment in the filling of the left ventricle (\"stiff ventricle\") caused by decreased compliance at a normal left atrial pressure. Systolic heart failure, which is an impairment in contractility, has a better response to positive inotropic agents. Most patients have a combination of both systolic and dia­stolic dysfunction.\nIn diastolic heart failure, filling of the left ventricle is slow or incomplete (i.e., decreased compliance) un­less left atrial pressures increase to maintain the ejec­tion fraction at the expense of increasing pulmonary and systemic venous congestion. Clinical findings in­clude dyspnea, which is the most common symptom, resulting from interstitial and pulmonary edema. Pathophysiologically, there is left atrial hypertension and pulmonary venous hypertension, leading to pul­monary congestion. Therapy is aimed at slowing the heart rate, which promotes filling of the left ventricle at low pressures. -Adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers are effective. Patients with diastolic dysfunction have a better survival rate than those with systolic dysfunction, because the ejection fraction is normal to slightly decreased, albeit at the expense of increased left atrial pressures.\nSystolic dysfunction is an impairment in contractil­ity of the left ventricle, or a defect in the ability of\nmyofibrils to shorten against a load. The left ventricle loses its ability to eject blood into the aorta, so the ejection fraction (i.e., stroke volume/left ventricular end-diastolic volume) is decreased (usually < 40%); the normal ejection fraction is 80/120, or 66%, with a range of 55% to 75%. The ejection fraction is mea­sured by echo cardiography or radionuclide ventricu­lography. Signs of isolated systolic dysfunction include fatigue, prerenal azotemia, cool skin, and mental obtundation. The left ventricular chamber eventually dilates and patients develop fatigue, dyspnea, and pe­ripheral edema, which are signs of right-sided heart failure. Examples of systolic dysfunction include post­ myocardial infarction, ischemic injury (e.g., acute myocardial infarction), and congestive cardiomyopa­thy. Therapy is aimed at improving the performance of the left ventricle with administration of positive inotropic agents and peripheral vasodilators  to de­crease peripheral resistance."

    "B": "Cytomegalovirus retinitis",
    "C": "Primary angle-closure glaucoma",
    "D": "Proliferative retinopathy",
    "answer": "A",
    "exp": "Thromboembolization from the diseased heart to the central retinal artery causes a diffuse retinal infarct that obscures the underlying vascular choroid, except where the retina is thinner in the fovea so that it appears red compared to the surrounding pale retina. The other listed choices are typically bilateral processes. Cytomegalovirus retinitis has edematous and hemorrhagic lesions; it is most often seen in immunocompromised patients. Primary angle-closure glaucoma typically occurs in hyperopic eyes, and some cases may be acute, with eye pain from elevated intraocular pressure.

    "answer": "B",
    "exp": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, with an overall prevalence of 0.5% in the adult population of the UK. The prevalence rises with age, affecting 1% of those aged 60-64 years, increasing to 9% of those aged over 80 years. It is associated with significant morbidity and a twofold increase in moality. This is mainly because of its association with underlying hea disease but also because of its association with systemic embolism and stroke. Pathogenesis AF is a complex arrhythmia characterised by both abnormal automatic firing and the presence of multiple interacting re-entry circuits looping around the atria. Episodes of AF are initiated by rapid bursts of ectopic beats arising from conducting tissue in the pulmonary veins or from diseased atrial tissue. It becomes sustained because of re-entrant conduction within the atria or sometimes because of continuous ectopic firing . Re-entry is more likely to occur in atria that are enlarged or in which conduction is slow, as is the case in many forms of hea disease. During episodes of AF, the atria beat rapidly but in an uncoordinated and ineffective manner. The ventricles are activated irregularly at a rate determined by conduction through the AV node. This produces the characteristic 'irregularly irregular' pulse. The ECG shows normal but irregular QRS complexes; there are no P waves but the baseline may show irregular fibrillation waves. Commonly, AF is classified as paroxysmal (intermittent episodes that self-terminate within 7 days) Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1534"

So when treating dyslipidemia for reducing cardiovascular events, the first target is LDL and\nnot HDL.\nDoubt and Controversy\nWhat is creating doubts in our mind is a table from Braunwald 8th/e p1008 according to which ‘Low HDL’ appears to\nbe better marker for prediction of future cardiovascular disease than ‘High LDL’\nAccording to this bar diagram in Braunnwald 8th/e pl008 - the adjusted hazard ratio for future cardiovascular events\nfor LDL is 1.62 while that of HDL is 2.32. But the text given in the book does clarify which one is better marker, (we\nhave given this table from Braunwald in our previous discussion on this topic in Nov 2009 Medicine).\nWe have tried to confirm this ‘Low HDL’ fact from various other books. But none of the texts clearly favored any one\nbetween these 2 to be the better marker. Both LDL and HDL are mentioned to be important.\nWe have also consulted several cardiologist on this. All of them say that the answer should be LDL.\nWell, Braunwald is text book of immense reputation, and any information or text given in the book does not need\nconfirmation from any other source. But what has added to the confusion is that the latest edition of Braunwald i.e.,\n9th/e has eliminated that diagram from the book and in the text have not clarified which one is better marker.\nInstead, the text states that Apolipo (a) and B 100 are better marker for predicting future cardiovascular events than\nLDL and HDL.\nWe are not absolutely sure of the answer, but we would for the time being go with LDL.\nAlso Know\nThe following lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities are associated with increased coronary risk.\nElevated total cholesterol\nElevated LDL cholesterol\nLow HDL cholesterol\nIncreased total to HDL cholesterol ratio\nIncreased non HDL cholesterol\nHypertriglyceridemia\nIncreased Lp(a)\nIncreased apolipoprotein B\nSmall dense LDL particles"

The inflammation that may come from rejection is not a risk for amyloid deposition. A transplanted heart does not have a functional pericardial sac, and though there may be some fibrous adhesions following surgery, they are not constrictive. Transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy have immune dysregulation that increases the risk for both carcinomas and lymphoid malignancies, but these are unlikely to involve the heart.

Coronary angioplasty, stenting and thrombolytic therapy has been done in pregnancy when indicated. Supine position and hypotension should be avoided. Labor: managed as with standard cardiac care. Elective delivery within two weeks of infarction should be avoided. Regional analgesia for pain in labor and p blockers for tachycardia may be used. Maternal pushing is avoided and second stage is shortened by forceps or vacuum. Syntocinon should be used in the third stage management as ergometrine may cause coronary artery spasm.

The most common post reperfusion arrhythmia is Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR)' - Problem Oriented Approach in Interventional Cardiology 'Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm is considered a reperfusion rhythm as it is often seen immediately after a successful reperfusion' - Washington manual of critical care /116 Myocardial Reperfusion, Dilated cardiomyopathy, Digitalis matoxication and Myocarditis may all produce Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythms (AIVR), however AIVR is the most common arrhythmia seen after myocardial Reperfusion. AIVR is also the most charachteristic arrhythmia seen after reperfusion has begun and hence Myocardial Reperfusion is the single best answer of choice. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR) AIVR is an automatic rhythm originating within the ventricle with rates between 40 to,120 beats / min AIVR is believed to be caused by abnormal automaticity and is considered to be a brief self limiting arrhythmia , that does not usually require any specific treatment unless the patient is symptomatic The onset of this arrhythmia is gradual (non paroxysmal) and occurs when the rate of ventricular tachycardia exceeds the sinus rate because of sinus slowing or SA / AV block AIVR is a characteristic feature of myocardial reperfusion, and when it occurs in the setting of myocardial infarction and coronary reperfusion it is also called Reperfusion Arrhythmia' or Reperfusion Rhythm'. `It commonly occurs at the moment of reperfusion of an occluded coronaryaery' - Braunwald AIVR can be seen in the absence of any structural hea disease but is usually seen in patients who have an underlying structure hea disease. 0.12 sec) (Bizzare) * Fusion beats * Capture beats * AV dissociation * Rhythm: Regular \" align=\"left\" height=\"94\" width=\"226\">Treatment of Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm No specific treatment is usually required (No treatment in Asymptomatic patients) Since the ventricular rate usually ranges the same as sinus rhythm, hemodynamic compromise does not occur Also the condition is self limiting and transient and does not appear to affect the patients clinical course or prognosis.

    "question": "An 11-year-old boy had a sore throat, no cough, tonsillar exudates, and 38.3deg C fever 3 weeks ago, and a throat culture was positive for group A b-hemolytic Streptococcus. On the follow-up examination, the child is afebrile. His pulse is 85/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg. On auscultation, a diastolic mitral murmur is audible, and there are diffuse rales over both lungs. Over the next 2 days, he has several episodes of atrial fibrillation accompanied by signs of acute left ventricular failure. Which of the following pathologic changes occurring in this child's heart is most likely to be the cause of the left ventricular failure?",
    "A": "Amyloidosis",
    "B": "Fibrinous pericarditis",
    "C": "Mitral valve fibrosis",
    "D": "Myocarditis",
    "answer": "D",
    "exp": "This boy developed acute left ventricular failure, an uncommon but serious complication of acute rheumatic fever. Pancarditis with pericarditis, endocarditis, and myocarditis develop during the acute phase. Myocarditis led to dilation of the ventricle so severe that the mitral valve became incompetent. Rheumatic heart disease is now uncommon, and the number of children that require prophylactic antibiotic therapy to prevent just one case is >10,000. Chronic inflammatory conditions may produce reactive systemic amyloidosis, but this is unlikely to occur given the limited and episodic nature of the streptococcal infection that causes rheumatic heart disease. Fibrinous pericarditis can produce an audible friction rub, but it is not constrictive, and the amount of fluid and fibrin is not great, so no tamponade occurs. Myocardial necrosis associated with myocarditis is patchy, and the ventricle does not rupture to produce tamponade. Fibrosis and fusion of the mitral valve leaflets develop over weeks to months and indicate chronic rheumatic valvulitis. Verrucous vegetations are small and may produce a murmur, but they do not interfere greatly with valve function and do not tend to embolize."

Since the outer cortical plate of the mandible is thick in the molar region, the lingual plate is the one most frequently perforated. According to the studies of Tschiassny, initial infection of the submandibular space, particularly in cases of the second and third molars, is due to the fact that the apices of these teeth are situated below the mylohyoid ridge in 65% of cases. He also noted that because the apices of the roots of the first molar are above this ridge in about 60% of the cases, infection of the sublingual space is most common in cases of infection of this tooth. \nRef: Shafer's textbook of oral pathology 7th edition page 510"

Blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg; there is mild jugular venous distension, soft bibasilar crackles, an S3 gallop, and minimal pedal edema. An echocardiogram shows left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% without segmental wall-motion abnormality. The patient desires to keep medications to a minimum What change in his management would you recommend at this time?",
    "A": "Add spironolactone",

    "C": "Add digoxin",
    "D": "Add a calcium-channel blocker",
    "answer": "B",
    "exp": "There is very good evidence that ACE inhibitors should be used in patients with heart failure (HF) and a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. ACE inhibitors stabilize left, ventricular remodeling, improve symptoms, reduce hospitalization, and decrease mortality. Beta- blocker therapy represents a major advance in the treatment of patients with HF and depressed systolic function. These drugs interfere with the harmful effects of sustained activation of the adrenergic nervous system by competitively blocking beta-receptors. When given with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers stabilize left ventricular remodeling, improve patient symptoms, reduce hospitalization, and decrease mortality. An aldosterone antagonist is recommended for patients with NYHA class III or IV symptoms who have a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35% and who are still symptomatic despite receiving standard therapy with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers. Likewise, digoxin may improve symptoms and decrease hospitalization rates in patients with HF but has not been shown to prolong life. Neither of these drugs is indicated in this patient with mild symptoms. Furosemide is used to improve symptoms but does not prolong survival. Since this patient wants to minimize medications, an ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker are better first choices because they confer a survival advantage. An implantable defibrillator is indicated in systolic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% in order to prevent sudden cardiac death but is not indicated in this patient whose ejection fraction is 40%."

    "B": "Neuraxial analgesia",
    "C": "Inhalational analgesia",
    "D": "Spinal anaesthesia",
    "answer": "B",
    "exp": "Ans. is Neuraxial analgesia Pain and anxiety during labour and delivery provoke catecholamine surge resulting in tachycardia, hypertension increased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance.This may prove to be catastrophic for patients with heart disease who may develop ischemia or heart failure.* This can be prevented by providing adequate labour analgesia.Earlier spinal neuraxial blockade was used for this purpose.It was believed that sympathetic neuraxial blockade will provide adequate analgesia. However, sympathetic blockade caused by standard neuraxial techniques can produce dramatic cardiovascular changes with decrease in cardiac output secondary to a reduction in preload following sympathetic blockade.Standard spinal blockade is considered a cardiovascular risk due to the sympathetic blockade that decreases cardiac preload by causing arteriolar dilatation. Arteriolar dilatation will reduce systemic vascular resistance and may cause reflex tachycardia.Standard spinal block may produce following changes: -Low systemic vascular resistance can reverse the pressure gradient across a left to right intracardiac shunt, leading to catastrophic decrease in pulmonary blood flow.These changes are usually more severe with a single shot spinal anaesthesia compared with central neuraxial blockade. However, in the last few years, neuraxial blockade has benefitted from important technical and pharmacological improvements that allow it to be tailored to the patients' needs and obstetric course.Safe neuraxial techniques avoid standard techniques with fixed doses and instead should tailor the anaesthetic to the patient.Single shot spinal anaesthesia is not recommended for the cardiac pregnant patient, in contrast a well-controlled epidural or spinal anaesthesia is beneficial even for the most severe cardiac disease.If a rapid decrease in preload and afterload are likely to compromise cardiac status then local anaesthetic is eliminated from the intrathecal portion of the spinal epidural (CSE) and only intrathecal opioid is administered.In these patients the epidural should be dosed slowly with local anaesthetic to maintain stable hemodynamics and adequate uteroplacental blood flow.The technique carries the risk of potential delay in the discovery of poorly placed epidural catheter after a combined spinal epidural (CSE): however, epidural catheters placed during a CSE are less likely to fail.If neuraxial analgesia is not an option for a high-risk cardiac patient, then the advisability of vaginal delivery may need to be considered.Although patient controlled analgesia (PCA) via intravascular opioid infusion with remifantil or fentanyl is performed in many patients, this may not be good alternative for the cardiac patient.Pain control is typically suboptimal leading to increased catecholamine release. Furthermore to achieve, even moderately effective analgesia, the dose of opioid required could suppress ventilation. The resultant carbon di-oxide retention can cause respiratory acidosis, further catecholamine release and increase pulmonary hypertension leading to arrhythmias, ischemia, or heart, failure.Mitral stenosisThe main goal of anaesthetic technique is to avoid \"tachycardia\" as the time required for left ventricular diastolic filling is prolonged.Segmental epidural anaesthesia is recommended early during labour, avoiding significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance with reflex tachycardia.Cesarean section is also managed with segmental epidural anaesthesia.Phenylephrine is the vasopressor of choice.Patients with prominent symptoms are at significant risk in peripartum period and should receive peripheral and pulmonary artery catheter monitoring continued for a minimum of 24 hour after delivery since tolerance to postpartum fluid shifts may be poor.Mitral regurgitationMitral insufficiency as well as mitral value prolapsed are well tolerated by the pregnant patient since a decrease in SVR will reduce the regurgitant flow.Atrial arrhythmias and risk of embolism from atrial thrombi are important complications.Pain will automatically increase systemic vascular resistance and adequate labour analgesia should minimize peripheral vasoconstriction and thus avoid an increase in left ventricular after load associated with labour pain.Additional sympathetic blockade further decreases systemic vascular resistance.Neuraxial techniques are indicated for labour, vaginal delivery and cesarean section."

    "exp": "The child described in the question has no cyanosis or murmur, no cardiac or pulmonary vascular abnormalities by chest x-ray, and no evidence of structural anomalies by echocardiogram, and therefore is unlikely to have an underlying gross anatomic defect. The ECG pattern in the figure shows the configuration of preexcitation, the pattern seen in the WPW syndrome. These patients have an aberrant atrioventricular conduction pathway, which causes the early ventricular depolarization appearing on the ECG as a shortened PR interval. The initial slow ventricular depolarization wave is referred to as the delta wave. Seventy percent of patients with WPW syndrome have single or repeated episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, which can cause the symptoms described in the question. The preexcitation ECG pattern and WPW syndrome can occur in Ebstein malformation, but this is unlikely in the absence of cyanosis and with a normal echocardiogram. If ventricular tachycardia were present, the symptoms would likely be more profound. Active play and exposure to over-the-counter medications containing sympathomimetics in a healthy 4- year-old child can cause symptoms such as those described in the question in children with WPW syndrome by precipitating paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia."

    "answer": "C",
    "exp": "Tolerance to organic nitrates may develop in a few days or less, depending on the dose and frequency of administration. Continuous exposure to nitroglycerin through use of a transdermal skin patch has frequently caused nitrate tolerance. A daily 10-to-14-hour drug ­free period will prevent nitrate tolerance. Nitrate tolerance is a cellular tolerance caused by depletion of sulfhydryl groups required for receptor signal trans­duction. The drug-free interval allows time for these groups to replenish before the next period of drug exposure. Nitrates are metabolized by hepatic nitro reductase, and there is neither evidence of cytochrome P 450 involvement nor of induction of this enzyme by drugs. Although the patient's symptoms could be caused by increased physical activity or onset of vaso­spasm, these are less likely causes in a patient with continuous nitroglycerin exposure. Vasospasm is also unlikely because the episodes occurred during ex­ertion."

    "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Increase in A.V. node refractoriness Digitalis in arrhvthmao Digitalis is the drug of choice for controlling ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation (AF) with heart failure.o Digitalis reduces the ventricular rate in AF by decreasing the number of impulses that are able to pass down the A-V node and bundle of His -It increases effective refractory period-ERP (i.e refractoriness) of A-V node by direct, vagomimetic and antiadrenergic action - the minimum interval between consecutive impulses that can successfully traverse the conducting tissue is increased. A degree of A-V block is naturally established in AF. Because of the relatively long ERP of A-V node, many atrial impulses impinge on it while it is still refractory; others falling early in the relative refractory period get extinguished by decremental conduction - These concealed impulses leave upper margin of A-V node refractory for a further period. Thus, any influence which increases atrial rate in AF (e.g. digitalis), by itself reduces ventricular rate.o Inhibition of Na+ K+ ATPase is responsible for inotropic action of digitalis, not for antiarrhythmic action.# Digitalis has two important pharmacological actions -Increased contractility of heart by inhibiting Na+ K+ ATPase - This action is beneficial in cardiac failure. Increased refractoriness of SA node and AV node -| automaticity and conduction - This action is beneficial in arrhythmia."

Dooo- needle time should be \u0005 30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK ; maintain aPTTT at 1.5-2.0 control (\u000150-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists \u000190 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI. Later coronary angiography after fibrinolysis generally reserved for pts with recurrent angina or positive stress test. The initial management of NSTEMI (non-Q MI) is different . In paicular, fibrinolytic therapy should not be Additional Standard Treatment (Whether or not reperfusion therapy is undeaken): * Hospitalize in CCU with continuous ECG monitoring. * IV line for emergency arrhythmia treatment. * Pain control: (1) Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg IV q5-10min until pain is relieved or side effects develop ; (2) nitroglycerin 0.3 mg SL if systolic bp \u0001 100 mmHg; for refractory pain: IV nitroglycerin (begin at 10 g/min, titrate upward to maximum of 200 g/min, monitoring bp closely); do not administer nitrates within 24 h of sildenafil or within 48 h of tadalafil (used for erectile dysfunction); (3) -adrenergic antagonists * Oxygen 2-4 L/min by nasal cannula (maintain O2 saturation \u0001 90%). * Mild sedation (e.g., diazepam 5 mg PO qid). * Soft diet and stool softeners (e.g., docusate sodium 100-200 mg/d). * -Adrenergic blockers reduce myocardial O2 consumption, limit infarct size, and reduce moality. Especially useful in pts with hypeension, tachycardia, or persistent ischemic pain; contraindications include active CHF, systolic bp \u0005 95 mmHg, hea rate \u0005 50 beats/min, AV block,or history of bronchospasm. Administer IV (e.g., metoprolol 5 mg q5-10min to total dose of 15 mg), followed by PO regimen (e.g., metoprolol 25-100 mg bid). * Anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents: Pts who receive fibrinolytic therapy are begun on heparin and aspirin as indicated above. In absence of fibrinolytic therapy, administer aspirin, 160-325 mg qd, and low-dose heparin (5000 U SC q12h for DVT prevention). Full-dose IV heparin (PTT 2 control) or low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h) followed by oral anticoagulants is recommended for pts with severe CHF, presence of ventricular thrombus by echocardiogram, or large dyskinetic region in anterior MI. Oral anticoagulants are continued for 3 to 6 months, then replaced by aspirin. * ACE inhibitors reduce moality in pts following acute MI and should be prescribed within 24 h of hospitalization for pts with STEMI--e.g., captopril (6.25 mg PO test dose) advanced to 50 mg PO tid. ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely after discharge in pts with CHF or those with asymptomatic LV dysfunction ; if ACE inhibitor intolerant, use angiotensin receptor blocker (e.g., valsaan or candesaan). * Serum magnesium level should be measured and repleted if necessary to reduce risk of arrhythmias."

    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of dyspnea, chest pain, and several syncopal episodes. His symptoms have worsened over the past few months and his third syncopal episode prompted this visit. On examination, a systolic ejection murmur is auscultated with an ejection click in the right second intercostal space. Rales are present at the lung bases. He has a history of rheumatic fever in his twenties. Which of the following might explain the angina pectoris in this patient?",
    "A": "Increased ventricular wall tension limits perfusion",

    "C": "Pulmonary hypeension decreases the PO2 of aerial blood",
    "D": "Stenotic valves occlude the coronary aeries",
    "answer": "A",
    "exp": "The angina pectoris seen in aoic stenosis is caused by left ventricular hyperophy. The ventricle must generate greater pressures to overcome the occluded outflow tract, and hyperophy occurs. This contributes to cardiac ischemia in several ways. An increased myocardial mass increases myocardial oxygen demand, while the increased wall tension decreases perfusion. The myocardium is perfused during diastole, and coronary perfusion relies on this relaxation. When mural diastolic pressures remain elevated in hyperophy, perfusion is limited and ischemia results. Hyperophy does not accelerate atherosclerosis. Pulmonary hypeension seen in aoic stenosis, results in pulmonary edema and a thus a mild hindrance to alveolar gas exchange. One would not expect the PO2 to decrease enough to cause angina. Stenotic valves do not occlude the coronary aeries. Ref: Clark M.B., Friedewald W.T. (2011). Chapter 113.

Cardiomyopathies are thus a diverse group that includes inflammatory disorders (e.g., myocarditis), immunologic diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis), systemic metabolic disorders (e.g., hemochromatosis), muscular dystrophies, and genetic disorders of myocardial fibers. In many cases, the cardiomyopathy is of unknown etiology and thus is termed idiopathic; however, a number of previously \"idiopathic\" cardiomyopathies have been shown to be the consequence of specific genetic abnormalities in cardiac energy metabolism or in structural and contractile proteins.

Fixed atherosclerosis with no change in structureo A fixed obstruction of 75% or greater generally causes symptomatic ischemia induced by excercise --> classical angina.o With this degree of obustruction, the augmented coronary flow provided by compensatory vasodilatation is no longer sufficient to meet even moderate increase in myocardial demand.o A 90% stenosis can lead to inadequate blood flow even at rest.2. Disruption of plaque and acute coronary syndromeo In most patients with MI, unstable angina, and sudden cardiac death, the attack is precipitated by abrupt plaque change (plaque disruption) followed by thrombosis.o Acute plague change (plaque disruption) may be any of the following types ?(a) Rupture/fissuring, exposing highly thrombogenic plaque constituents to blood.(b) Erosion/ulceration, exposing the thrombogenic subendothelial basement membrane to blood.(c) Hemorrhage into the plaque, expanding its volume.o All these changes lead to exposure of the thrombogenic constituents of plaque or vessel wall, this in turn activates platelets and there is platelets aggregation with formation of thrombus.o This can precipitate following acute coronary syndrome -(i) If thrombus occludes the vessel completely --> Transmural myocardial infarction.(ii) If thrombus occludes the vessel paially (incomplete) --> Unstable angina or acute subendocardial infarction.(iii) Paial occlusion by thrombus with possible embolus led to regional myocardial ischemia that induces a fatal ventricular arrhythmia --> sudden cardiac death.3.

    "exp": "Ans. c. EC followed by percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (Ref: Harrison 19/e p1539, 18/e p1932)\"Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy has subsequently become a mainstay of the management of rheumatic mitral stenosis. In the past, closed or open commisurotomy (after the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass) was the mainstay of therapy for rheumatic mitral stenosis. Currently, this procedure is most often performed using trans-septal access to the left atrium and a balloon catheter developed by a Japanese surgeon, Kanji Inoue. The dumbbell-shaped Inoue balloon catheter allows stable and sequential dilation of the stenotic mitral valve. A favourable response to mitral dilation is predicated on the presence of fused mitral commissures, as seen in rheumatic disease. Dilation is relatively ineffective in the absence of commissural fusion.\"Management Strategy for Patients with Mitral Stenosis (MS) and Mild Symptoms. There is controversy as to whether patients with severe MS (MVA <1 cm2) and severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) (PASP >60 mmHg) should undergo percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV) or mitral valve replacement (MVR) to prevent right ventricular failure.

In the meantime coronary angiography is planned. Antiplatelet Therapy A. Aspirin (loading dose of 325 mg followed by 75-150 mg/day after lunch) reduces subsequent MI and cardiac death. B. Clopidogrel (loading dose 300 mg followed by 75 mg/day) in aspirin intolerant patients. Added benefit in reducing the motality is achieved by combining both aspirin and clopidogrel and can be used for a minimum of one month if PCI is planned or maximum of 9 months. C.

    "question": "A 63-year-old man is in stable condition after an acute myocardial infarction when he became hypotensive for 3 hours before paramedical personnel arrived. Over the next week, the serum urea nitrogen level increases to 48 mg/dL, the serum creatinine level increases to 5 mg/dL, and the urine output decrease. He undergoes hemodialysis for the next 2 weeks and then develops marked polyuria, with urine output of 2 to 3 L/day. His renal function gradually returns to normal. Release of which of the following substances most likely participated in the elevation of BUN, creatinine, and reduced urinary output?",
    "A": "Aldosterone",
    "B": "Endothelin",
    "C": "Erythropoietin",
    "D": "Natriuretic peptide",
    "answer": "B",
    "exp": "The most common cause of acute tubular necrosis is ischemic injury. The hypotension that develops after myocardial infarction causes decreased renal blood flow, with intrarenal vasoconstriction. Sublethal endothelial injury from reduced renal blood flow leads to the increased release of the vasoconstrictor endothelin and diminished amounts of the vasodilators nitric oxide and prostaglandin. The ischemic form of acute tubular injury is often accompanied by the rupture of the basement membrane (tubulorrhexis). An initiating phase that lasts approximately 1 day is followed by a maintenance phase during which progressive oliguria and increasing blood urea nitrogen levels occur, with salt and water overload. This is followed by a recovery phase, during which there is a steady increase in urinary output and hypokalemia. Eventually, the tubular function is restored. Treatment of this acute renal failure results in the recovery of nearly all patients. Aldosterone plays a role in sodium absorption. Erythropoietin drives RBC production. Natriuretic peptide increases when there is congestive heart failure, but does not lead to renal ischemia. Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) controls free water clearance."

    "question": "A female infant is born approximately 10 weeks prematurely (at 30 weeks) and weighs 1710 gm. She has respiratory distress syndrome and is treated with endogenous surfactant. She is intubated endotracheally with mechanical ventilation immediately after bih. Over the first 4 days after bih the ventilator pressure and the fraction of inspired oxygen are reduced. Beginning on the fifth day after bih, she has brief desaturations that become more persistent.She needs increased ventilator and oxygen suppo on the seventh day after bih. She becomes cyanotic. Fuher examination, echocardiogram, and x-rays reveal left atrial enlargement, an enlarged pulmonary aery, increased pulmonary vasculature, and a continuous machine-like murmur. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "A": "Persistent foramen ovale",
    "B": "Patent ductus aeriosus",
    "C": "Ventricular septal defect",
    "D": "Pulmonary stenosis",
    "answer": "B",
    "exp": "Patent ductus aeriosus.The presence of a murmur could be indicative of any of the conditions. The presence of a continuous machine-likemurmur is indicative of a patent ductus aeriosus (PDA). Usually, as in this case, the premature baby with PDA does not acutely become cyanotic and ill, although brief desaturations can occur that become more persistent. An atrial septal defect (ASD), such as a persistent foramen ovale, could be eliminated from the diagnosis because the murmur would be heard as an abnormal splitting of the second sound during expiration (answer a). A patent foramen ovale is a common echo finding in premature babies and is usually not followed up unless it appears remarkable to the pediatric cardiologist or there is a persistent murmur. A patent foramen ovale might result in only minimal or intermittent cyanosis during crying or straining to pass stool. A murmur caused by a ventricular septal defect (VSD, answer c), occurs between the first and second hea sounds (S1and S2) and is described as holosystolic (pansystolic) because the amplitude is high throughout systole. Pulmonary stenosis would be heard as a harsh systolic ejection murmur (answer d). PDA refers to the maintenance of the ductus aeriosus, a normal fetal structure. In the fetus, the ductus aeriosus allows blood to bypass the pulmonary circulation, since the lungs are not involved in CO2/O2exchange until after bih. The placenta subserves the function of gas exchange during fetal development. The ductus aeriosus shunts flow from the left pulmonary aery to the aoa. High oxygen levels after bih and the absence of prostaglandins from the placenta cause the ductus aeriosus to close in most cases within 24 hours. A PDA most often corrects itself within several months of bih, but may require infusion of indomethacin (a prostaglandin inhibitor) as a treatment, inseion of surgical plugs during catheterization, or actual surgical ligation."

    "exp": "Obstructive or non-obstructive Depending on whether the distoion of normal hea anatomy causes an obstruction of the outflow of blood from the left ventricle of the hea, HCM can be classified as obstructive or non-obstructive. The obstructive variant of HCM, hyperophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), has also historically been known as idiopathic hyperophic subaoic stenosis (IHSS) and asymmetric septal hyperophy (ASH). Another, non-obstructive variant of HCM is apical hyperophic cardiomyopathy, also called Yamaguchi Syndrome or Yamaguchi Hyperophy, first described in individuals of Japanese descent. Hyperophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which a poion of the hea becomes thickened without an obvious cause.This results in the hea being less able to pump blood effectively. Symptoms vary from none to feeling tired, leg swelling, and shoness of breath. It may also result in chest pain or fainting.Complications include hea failure, an irregular heabeat, and sudden cardiac death. It is often due to mutations in ceain genes involved with making hea muscle proteins. Other causes may include Fabry disease, Friedreich's ataxia, and ceain medications such as tacrolimus.It is a type of cardiomyopathy, a group of diseases that primarily affects the hea muscle. Diagnosis often involves an electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and stress testing. Genetic testing may also be done Upon cardiac catheterization, catheters can be placed in the left ventricle and the ascending aoa, to measure the pressure difference between these structures. In normal individuals, during ventricular systole, the pressure in the ascending aoa and the left ventricle will equalize, and the aoic valve is open. In individuals with aoic stenosis or with HCM with an outflow tract gradient, there will be a pressure gradient (difference) between the left ventricle and the aoa, with the left ventricular pressure higher than the aoic pressure. This gradient represents the degree of obstruction that has to be overcome in order to eject blood from the left ventricle. The Brockenbrough-Braunwald-Morrow sign is observed in individuals with HCM with outflow tract gradient. This sign can be used to differentiate HCM from aoic stenosis. In individuals with aoic stenosis, after a premature ventricular contraction (PVC), the following ventricular contraction will be more forceful, and the pressure generated in the left ventricle will be higher. Because of the fixed obstruction that the stenotic aoic valve represents, the post-PVC ascending aoic pressure will increase as well. In individuals with HCM, however, the degree of obstruction will increase more than the force of contraction will increase in the post-PVC beat. The result of this is that the left ventricular pressure increases and the ascending aoic pressure decreases, with an increase in the LVOT gradient. While the Brockenbrough-Braunwald-Morrow sign is most dramatically demonstrated using simultaneous intra-cardiac and intra-aoic catheters, it can be seen on routine physical examination as a decrease in the pulse pressure in the post-PVC beat in individuals with HCM Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 456"

    "D": "Refer for surgical embolectomy",
    "answer": "A",
    "exp": "This patient is presenting with massive pulmonary embolus with ongoing hypotension, right ventricular dysfunction, and profound hypoxemia requiring 100% oxygen.In this setting, continuing with anticoagulation alone is inadequate, and the patient should receive circulatory suppo with fibrinolysis if there are no contraindications to therapy.The major contraindications to fibrinolysis include hypeension >180/110 mmHg, known intracranial disease or prior hemorrhagic stroke, recent surgery, or trauma.The recommended fibrinolytic regimen is recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA), 100 mg IV over 2 h.Heparin should be continued with the fibrinolytic to prevent a rebound hypercoagulable state with the dissolution of the clot.There is a 10% risk of major bleeding with fibrinolytic therapy with a 1-3% risk of intracranial haemorrhage. The only indication for fibrinolysis in pulmonary embolus (PE) is for massive PE presenting with life-threatening hypotension, right ventricular dysfunction, and refractory hypoxemia.In submassive PE presenting with preserved blood pressure and evidence of right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram, the decision to pursue fibrinolysis is made on a case-by-case situation. In addition to fibrinolysis, the patient should also receive circulatory suppo with vasopressors.Dopamine and dobutamine are the vasopressors of choice for the treatment of shock in PE. Caution should be taken with the ongoing high-volume fluid administration as a poorly functioning right ventricle may be poorly tolerant of additional fluids.Ongoing fluids may worsen right ventricular ischemia and fuher dilate the right ventricle, displacing the interventricular septum to the left to worsen cardiac output and hypotension. If the patient had contraindications to fibrinolysis and was unable to be stabilized with vasopressor suppo, referral for surgical embolectomy should be considered.Referral for inferior vena cava filter placement is not indicated at this time. The patient should be stabilized hemodynamically as a first priority.The indications for inferior vena cava filter placement are active bleeding, precluding anticoagulation, and recurrent deep venous thrombosis on adequate anticoagulation."

    "exp": "Answer is A (Verapamil) AV nodal blocking agents such as Calcium channel blockers, Beta blockers and Digoxin should not be used to treat Atrial Fibrillation in patients with WPW Syndrome. Use of these drugs may result in an acute increase in rate over the Accessory pathway placing the patient at risk for development of VF. Procainamide is the drug of choice for treatment of Atrial Fibrillation in patients with WPW Syndrome who are hemodynamically stable. Ibutilide and Amiodarone are also effective. Treatment of Hemodynamically Stable Atrial Fibrillation in Patients with WPW Syndrome Procainamide is the drug of choice for treatment of Atrial Fibrillation in patients with WPW Syndrome who are hemodynamically stable. Ibutilide and Amiodarone are also effective. Avoid AV nodal blocking agents such as Calcium channel blockers, Beta blockers and Digoxin The standard treatment of atrial fibrillation is to slow the ventricular rate with AV nodal blocking agents such as Calcium channel blockers, Beta blockers and Digoxin. In Patients with Pre-excitation (WPW Syndrome) the use of these agents should be avoided (contraindicated). Atrial Fibrillation in patients with WPW Syndrome is typically associated with rapid conduction over the AV node as well as the Accessory Pathway. AV nodal blockers slow down conduction and decrease the number of impulses entering the ventricles anterogradely through the AV node (but may increase the rate of conduction through the accessory pathway). This will reduce the number of impulses bombarding the ventricular end of the bypass tract or accessory pathway rendering the bypass tract less refractory. This may paradoxically increase the rate of conduction through the accessory pathway placing the patient at risk for development of VF. 'Digoxin appears to shoen the refractory period of the Accessory pathway directly and thus increases the ventricular rate' - Harrison 'Verapamil appears to shoen the refractory period of the accessory pathway indirectly by causing vasodilatation and a reflex increase in sympathetic tone' - Harrison"

    "exp": "Ans: b (Post capillary venodilation)Ref Thripathi 5 ed., Pg. 489Nitroglycerine and other nitrates act by dilating veins more than arteries. This results in peripheral pooling of blood which leads decreased venous return. So the preload is reduced and eventually, decreased cardiac work.In variant angina - nitrates work by dilating the large coronary vessels.Mechanism of action of other antianginal drugsBeta blockers - they decrease heart rate, inotropic state and mean BP. This results in reduced cardiac work.Calcium channel blockers - it causes smooth muscle (vascular) relaxation and negative chronotropic, inotropic and dromotropic actionK+ channel openers - e.g., nicorandil. It causes smooth muscle relaxation.Dipyridamole - prevents uptake and degradation of adenosine. Adenosine is a vasodilator.Trimetazidine - it improves myocardial glucose utilization through inhibition of fatty acid metabolism (LC3- KAT inhibitor)Ranolazine - it inhibits late I current (funny current inhibitor). It also inhibits LC3- KAT.Notes on NitratesMOA - it is more venodilator than arteriolar dilator.Short acting - GlyceryltrinitrateNitroglycerineLong acting - Isosorbide dinitrate (short acting if sublingual)Isosorbide mononitrateAdverse effects- Headache Flushing, weakness, palpitation Methhemoglobinaemia RashesTolerance to the drug occurs if the drug is continuously present in the body.All except Isosorbide mononitrate undergo extensive firstpass metabolism in liver."

Aortic stenosis (Ref: Harrison 19/e p1529. 18/e p 1939)Patients of aortic stenosis have dyspnea, syncope and angina.'Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasing obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decades. Exertional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms. Often, there is a history of insidious progression of fatigue and dyspnea associated with gradual curtailment of activities. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability.: Exertional syncope may result from a decline in arterial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in non-exercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

    "D": "Retropharyngeal infection",
    "answer": "B",
    "exp": "Ludwig described a clinical entity characterised by a brawny swelling of the submandibular region combined with inflammatory oedema of the mouth. It is these combined cervical and intraoral signs that constitute the characteristic feature of the lesion, as well as the accompanying putrid halitosis. The infection is often caused by a virulent streptococcal infection associated with anaerobic organisms and sometimes with other lesions of the floor of the mouth such as carcinoma. The infection encompasses both sides of the mylohyoid muscle causing oedema and inflammation such that the tongue may be displaced upwards and backwards, giving rise to dysphagia and subsequentlyto painful obstruction of the airway. Unless treated, cellulitis may extend beneath the deep fascial layers of the neck to involve the larynx, causing glottic oedema and airway compromise. Antibiotic therapy should be instituted as soon as possible using intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as amoxycillin or cefuroxime, combined with metronidazole to combat the anaerobes. In advanced cases when the swelling does not subside rapidly with such treatment, a curved submental incision may be used to drain both submandibular triangles. The mylohyoid muscle may be incised to decompress the floor of the mouth and corrugated drains placed in the wound, which is then lightly sutured. This operation may be conducted under local anaesthetic. Rarely, a tracheostomy may be necessary. Bailey & Love,25th,731"

Ludwig's angina usually begins in the submandibular space, and then rapidly spreads to involve the sublingual space, usually on a bilateral basis.o Most common cause is infection of the root of the teeth (Dental infection), especially 2nd and 3rd mandibular molar. Other causes are mouth injury, mandibular fracture, and submandibular sialadenitis.o Since most cases of Ludwig's angina are related to a dental cause, it is not surprising that the bacterial cultures mirror the oral flora.o These infections are almost always the result of mixed flora, involving both aerobes and anaerobes. The most commonly reported aerobes are alpha-hemolytic streptococci, followed by staphylococcus. The anerobic bacteria are peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, Veillonella and Spirochaeta.o Submandibular space infection may also spread posteriorly to the carotid sheath or retropharyngeal space or both, by crossing the lateral pharyngeal space."

It is the abnormal leaking of blood backwards from the left ventricle, through the mitral valve, into the left atrium, when the left ventricle contracts, i.e. there is regurgitation of blood back into the left atrium.MR is the most common form of valvular hea disease.severity is determined by intensity of systolic murmer across mitral valve The degree of severity of MR can be quantified by the regurgitant fraction, which is the percentage of the left ventricular stroke volume that regurgitates into the left atrium. regurgitant fraction = {\\displaystyle {\\frac {V_{mitral}-V_{aoic}}{V_{mitral}}}\\times 100\\%} \\frac{V_{mitral} - V_{aoic}} {V_{mitral}} \\times 100\\% where Vmitral and Vaoic are, respectively, the volumes of blood that flow forward through the mitral valve and aoic valve during a cardiac cycle. Methods that have been used to assess the regurgitant fraction in mitral regurgitation include echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, fast CT scan, and cardiac MRI. The echocardiographic technique to measure the regurgitant fraction is to determine the forward flow through the mitral valve (from the left atrium to the left ventricle) during ventricular diastole, and comparing it with the flow out of the left ventricle through the aoic valve in ventricular systole. This method assumes that the aoic valve does not suffer from aoic insufficiency. Another way to quantify the degree of MR is to determine the area of the regurgitant flow at the level of the valve. This is known as the regurgitant orifice area, and correlates with the size of the defect in the mitral valve. One paicular echocardiographic technique used to measure the orifice area is measurement of the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA). The flaw of using PISA to determine the mitral valve regurgitant orifice area is that it measures the flow at one moment in time in the cardiac cycle, which may not reflect the average performance of the regurgitant jet.

Among these are excessive or redundant mitral leaflet tissue, which is commonly associated with myxomatous degeneration and greatly increased concentrations of acid mucopolysaccharide MVP is a frequent finding in patients with heritable disorders of connective tissue, including the Marfan syndrome. In most patients with MVP, however, myxomatous degeneration is confined to the mitral (or less commonly the tricuspid or aoic) valves without other clinical or pathologic manifestations of disease. The posterior leaflet is usually more affected than the anterior and the mitral valve annulus is often greatly dilated.

Usually, anatomic sites contiguous to mucous membranes are not sterile and have characteristic normal flora.The skin flora differs as a function of location. Skin adjacent to mucous membranes may share some of the normal flora of the GI system. Overall, the predominant bacteria on the skin surface are S. epidermidis and Propionibacterium, an anaerobic diphtheroid.The mouth is part of the GI tract, but its indigenous flora shows some distinct differences. While anaerobes are present in large numbers, particularly in the gingival crevice, the eruption of teeth at 6 to 9 months of age leads to colonization by organisms such as S. mutans and Streptococcus sanguis, both a-hemolytic streptococci. An edentulous person loses b-hemolytic streptococci as normal flora.The GI tract is sterile at birth and soon develops characteristic flora as a function of diet. In the adult, anaerobes such as B. fragilis and Bifidobacterium may outnumber coliforms and enterococci by a ratio of 1000:1. The colon contains 1011 to 1012 bacteria per gram of feces.Soon after birth, the vagina becomes colonized by lactobacilli. As the female matures, lactobacilli may still be predominant, but anaerobic cocci, diphtheroid, and anaerobic, gram-negative rods also are found as part of the indigenous flora. Changes in the chemical or microbiologic ecology of the vagina can have marked effects on normal flora and may promote infection such as vaginitis or vaginosis.Escherichia coli are among the most common group of gram-negative rods isolated in the laboratory. It is fairly easily identified in the laboratory. It ferments mannitol and is lactose positive. The organism is part of normal body flora but is a very efficient opportunist.

    "exp": "Absence of a \"RS complex,\" Concordance of QRS simply means \"all up\" or \"all down. right bundle branch block (RBBB) is a hea block in the right bundle branch of the electrical conduction system During a right bundle branch block, the right ventricle is not directly activated by impulses travelling through the right bundle branch. The left ventricle however, is still normally activated by the left bundle branch. These impulses are then able to travel through the myocardium of the left ventricle to the right ventricle and depolarize the right ventricle this way. As conduction through the myocardium is slower than conduction through the Bundle of His-Purkinje fibres, the QRS complex is seen to be widened. The QRS complex often shows an extra deflection that reflects the rapid depolarisation of the left ventricle followed by the slower depolarisation of the right ventricle. The criteria to diagnose a right bundle branch block on the electrocardiogram: The hea rhythm must originate above the ventricles (i.e., sinoatrial node, atria or atrioventricular node) to activate the conduction system at the correct point. The QRS duration must be more than 100 ms (incomplete block) or more than 120 ms (complete block). There should be a terminal R wave in lead V1 (often called \"R prime,\" and denoted by R, rR', rsR', rSR', or qR). There must be a prolonged S wave in leads I and V6 (sometimes referred to as a \"slurred\" S wave). The T wave should be deflected opposite the terminal deflection of the QRS complex.

    "C": "Adenosine",

    "answer": "C",
    "exp": "Ans. C: Adenosine Initial measures to terminate SVT should include vagal maneuvers. If unsuccessful, termination can be achieved with antiarrhythmic drugs whose primary effects increase refractoriness and/ or decrease conduction (negative dromotropic effect) over the AV node. These drugs can have direct (e.g., verapamil blocks the slow-inward calcium current of the AV node) or indirect effects (e.g., digoxin increases vagal tone to the AV node). In most patients, the drug of choice is either adenosine or verapamil. The advantages of adenosine include its rapid onset of action (usually within 10-25 seconds a peripheral vein), sho half-life (less than 10 seconds) and high degree of efficacy. Its sho half-life minimizes the severity of side effects, such as facial flushing, chest tightness, dyspnea and transient sinus arrest and/or atrioventricular block. In general, adenosine has an excellent safety record, but pause-dependent torsade de pointes may infrequently occur and transient atrial fibrillation may occur due to shoening of the atrial action potential. Adenosine should be given with caution to patients with bronchospasm and is contraindicated in those with sinus node dysfunction or second- or third-degree hea block. Dipyridamole potentates adenosine's effects by blocking its cellular uptake and aminophylline blunts its effects by competitive receptor antagonism. Sequential dosing can be given at 60 second intervals due to adenosine's rapid metabolism. In AV node reentry the most common site of termination is the anterograde slow pathway. Termination may also occur indirectly, i.e., due to adenosine - induced atrial or ventricular premature beats"

CK value in serum is increased in myocardial infarction. The CK level stas to rise within 3-6 hours of infarction. Therefore CK estimation is very useful to detect early cases. The CK level is not increased in hemolysis or in congestive hea failure and therefore CK has an advantage over LDH. Normal level of AST is 8-20U/L. The level is significantly elevated in Myocardial infarction. Isocitrate dehydrogenase is not elevated in myocardial infarction.

    "B": "Apolipoprotein",
    "C": "Endothelin",
    "D": "Factor VIII",
    "answer": "B",
    "exp": "Lipoprotein(a) is an altered form of LDL cholesterol that has the apolipoprotein B-100 portion of LDL linked to apolipoprotein A, and an increase in Lp(a) is independently associated with a risk for endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis. Apolipoprotein E promotes the metabolism and clearance of LDL. Drugs such as statins that affect LDL receptor activity do not affect Lp(a) concentration. Early in the course of atheroma formation, angiotensin and its receptor may play a role in the development of hypertension, which then becomes a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Endothelin is a vasoconstrictor with no known role in atherogenesis. Decreased factor VIII leads to abnormal bleeding. Von Willebrand factor is required for normal platelet adhesion to collagen, and its absence leads to abnormal bleeding."

If cardioversion is impossible, drugs that prolong the refractory period of the accessory connection should be used. IV procainamide or amiodarone is preferred, but any class Ia, class Ic, or class III antiarrhythmic can be used.

    "question": "In a hospital cardiac care unit, there are three patients with different cardiac conditions: a 52 year old man with dilated cardiomyopathy, an 18 year old girl with mitral valve prolapse, and a 30 year old man with infective endocarditis of the mitral valve. Which of the following features do all these patients most likely share?",
    "A": "Decreased compliance",
    "B": "Depressed myocardial contractility",
    "C": "Infectious etiology",
    "D": "Risk of systemic thromboembolism",
    "answer": "D",
    "exp": "Systemic thromboembolism may develop in each of these patients. Vegetations associated with infective endocarditis may undergo fragmentation and result in systemic thromboembolism. Stasis develops in dilated ventricles, which predisposes to formation of thrombi attached to the ventricular walls (mural thrombi). Mural thrombi may also form within the left atrium in the presence of mitral valve prolapse. Thromboemboli may originate from mural thrombi. Decreased compliance is a pathophysiologic alteration present in a variety of cardiac disorders in which there is impediment to expansion or relaxation of ventricular walls, such as restrictive cardiomyopathy, hyperophic cardiomyopathy, and constrictive pericarditis. This feature is not present in any of the conditions described in the question. Depressed myocardial contractility results from conditions that impair myocardial inotropism, such as dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic hea disease. Depressed inotropism is not present in infective endocarditis or mitral valve prolapse. Of the three conditions in the question stem, only infective endocarditis is definitely related to an infectious etiology, usually bacteria. Recall that mitral valve prolapse is due to myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve, sometimes associated with Marfan syndrome. The etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy is heterogeneous, and most cases are idiopathic. Of the remaining cases, viral infections, toxic insults (especially alcohol), metabolic disorders (hemochromatosis), pregnancy, and genetic influences are the underlying causes.

The essential feature of HCM is massive myocardial hyperophy,usually without ventricular dilation. The classic pattern involves dispropoionate thickening of the ventricularseptum relative to the left ventricle free wall (with a ratio of septum to free wall greater than 3 : 1), termed asymmetric septal hyperophy. In about 10% of cases, the hyperophy is concentric and symmetrical. On longitudinal sectioning, the normally round-to-ovoid left ventricular cavity may be compressed into a \"banana-like\" configuration by bulging of the ventricular septum into the lumen. Although marked hyperophy can involve the entire septum, it is usually most prominent in the subaoic region. The left ventricular outflow tract often exhibits a fibrous endocardial plaque associated with thickening of the anterior mitral leaflet. The most impoant histologic features of HCM myocardium are: (1) massive myocyte hyperophy (2) haphazard disarray of bundles of myocytes, individual myocytes, and contractile elements in sarcomeres within cells (termed myofiber disarray). (3) interstitial and replacement fibrosis Mutations causing HCM are found most commonly in the gene encoding b-myosin heavy chain (b-MHC), followed by the genes coding for cardiac TnT, a-tropomyosin, and myosin-binding protein C (MYBP-C)."

    "C": "Protamine sulfate",
    "D": "Aprotinin",
    "answer": "C",
    "exp": "Heparin is reversed by the administration of protamine sulfate. Spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage is a rare but potentially fatal complication of anticoagulation. Heparin is much more frequently associated with spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage than are oral agents. Advanced patient age and poor regulation of coagulation times also increase the likelihood of bleeding complications. Most cases of retroperitoneal hemorrhage present with flank pain and signs of peritoneal irritation suggestive of an acute intra-abdominal process. CT scans are most useful in confirming the diagnosis and following the course of the bleeding. Successful management is usually nonoperative and consists of the discontinuation of anticoagulants, reversal of anticoagulation, possible transfusion of clotting factors, and repletion of intravascular volume with intravenous fluids. Warfarin inhibits synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, whereas heparin potentiates antithrombin III activity. Aprotinin is a protease inhibitor that decreases the inflammatory and fibrinolytic response and is used in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery to reduce bleeding complications. Lepirudin is an anticoagulant that is used in patients who develop heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Thrombin can be used topically as a hemostatic agent."

    "question": "A 63-year-old woman with long-standing type 2 diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and controlled systolic congestive heart failure following a previous anterior myocardial infarction presents for a routine office visit. She denies any significant complaints. The patient faithfully takes her glargine insulin, lisinopril, carvedilol, furosemide, and aspirin. On examination her blood pressure is 122/82, pulse 85, RR 14, with clear lungs, regular heartbeat, and 1+ bilateral pedal edema. You review the chart and find that her baseline creatinine is 1.5 mg/dL with an estimated glomerular filtration (GFR) rate of 42 mL/min.

    "B": "The patient's heart failure has caused decreased renal perfusion resulting in the metabolic abnormalities.",
    "C": "The patient has been overtreated with diuretics leading to intravascular volume depletion and acidosis.",
    "D": "The patient's aspirin use has led to toxicity in the setting of acute kidney injury and hence the metabolic acidosis.",
    "answer": "A",
    "exp": "Type 4 renal tubular acidosis occurs when there is distal nephron dysfunction leading to disproportionate levels of hyperkalemia and acidosis compared to the degree of kidney disease encountered. This is most commonly seen in patients with long-standing diabetes and can be exacerbated by the use of non-steroidal, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. A patient with congestive heart failure and renal hypoperfusion can develop prerenal azotemia, but you would expect clinical evidence of decompensated heart failure and an elevated BUN to creatinine ratio (well above 10/1). A patient who has been over diuresis will tend to have hypokalemia, a higher BUN/Cr ratio and a contraction alkalosis. Salicylate poisoning typically requires a significant ingestion (not mentioned in this question) and causes a wide-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Use of ACE inhibitors can lead to hyperkalemia but neither ACE inhibitors nor beta-blockers typically lead to a Type 4 RTA."

    "C": "Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea",
    "D": "Prerenal azotemia",
    "answer": "B",
    "exp": "A hepatojugular reflux indicates liver congestion caused by the backup of blood into the venous circula­tion, secondary to problems in the right heart (e.g., right-sided heart failure, tricuspid stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation)\nAn S3 heart sound occurs during the rapid-filling phase of the ventricle in early diastole. In mitral valve incompetence and increased preload in the left ventri­cle, an S3 heart sound is an excellent indicator of ventricular failure. The increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure is reflected back into the left atrium, with a subsequent increase in the hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary veins. When pulmonary venous pressure is greater than the pulmonary capillary on­co tic pressure, a transudate leaks first into the intersti­tium (Kerley lines on a chest radiograph) and eventu­ally into the alveoli, resulting in pulmonary edema and congestion.\nDyspnea, or the sensation of difficult or uncomfort­able breathing, is the most common symptom of left sided heart failure. When a patient with left-sided heart failure lies down, the reduced gravitational force increases venous return to the heart. Because the left ventricle cannot handle the increased load, the blood backs up into the lungs, producing dyspnea. Paroxys­mal nocturnal dyspnea specifically refers to a choking sensation that wakens the patient at night. It usually subsides) to 20 minutes after the patient stands up, opens the window, and takes deep breaths.\nAnother finding associated with left-sided heart fail­ure is reduced renal perfusion, which occurs during the day due to the decreased cardiac output. Reduced cardiac output decreases the effective arterial blood volume and the glomerular filtration rate, allowing a greater reabsorption of urea in the proximal tubule. Because creatinine is neither reabsorbed nor secreted in the tubules, a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate causes a minor increase in serum creatinine. The disproportionate increase in the blood urea nitrogen level over that of the serum creatinine is called prerenal azotemia."

MR typically occurs 7-10 days after an AMI, though this onset may vary according to the mechanism of MR. Papillary muscle rupture resulting in MR occurs within 1-14 days. Mild-to-moderate MR is often clinically silent and detected on doppler echocardiography performed during the early phase of AMI. In this case, MR rarely causes hemodynamic compromise. Severe acute MR that results from the rupture of papillary muscles or chordae tendineae results in abrupt hemodynamic deterioration with cardiogenic shock. Rapid diagnosis, hemodynamic stabilization, and prompt surgical intervention are needed because acute severe MR is associated with a high moality rate."

This same mechanism of fibrinolysis is shared by urokinase and tissue-plasminogen activator (tPA). Antithrombin III is a coagulation inhibitor that binds to and inactivates thrombin. Antithrombin III is anticoagulant, not fibrinolytic. Fibrin is not directly acted upon by streptokinase. It is indirectly cleaved through the action of plasmin.

In AFib, the hea beats fast and in no regular pattern or rhythm. With AFL, the hea beats fast, but in a regular pattern. The fast, but regular pattern of AFL is what makes it special. AFL makes a very distinct \"sawtooth\" pattern classification : * According to its duration Atrial fibrillation is classified into paroxysmal, persistent or permanent (the three P's). * Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is self-limiting and sinus rhythm restores spontaneously. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation lasts for less than 7 days and does not require intervention to conve to a normal rhythm such as electrical or chemical cardioversion. * Persistent atrial fibrillation lasts for greater than 7 days. The term persistent is used when there is a plan to use a rhythm control strategy and return the patient to sinus rhythm. * Permanent atrial fibrillation is present when atrial fibrillation is present 100% of the time for greater than 7 days and there are no interventions planned to restore sinus rhythm. * Typical Atrial Flutter (Common, or Type | Atrial Flutter) * Involves the IVC(Idioventricular Rhythm) & tricuspid isthmus in the reentry circuit. Can be fuher classified based on the direction of the circuit: C/ Anticlockwise Reentry. This is the commonest form of atrial flutter (90% of cases).

A \"baby\" aspirin-containing 80 mg (325 mg in the \"adult\" tablet) taken once a day may reduce this thrombotic risk, and also prevent the significantly increased risk for hemorrhage that is associated with higher doses. Acetaminophen is primarily analgesic in action. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has no significant effect upon atheroma progression.

The patient is given 325 mg aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin while awaiting the results of his blood work. His troponin I is 0.65 ng/mL (normal <0.04 ng/mL). The physician in the emergency department starts the patient on low-molecular-weight heparin. His pain is 3/10. Blood pressure is currently 154/78 and heart rate is 72.

    "C": "Admit the patient to a monitored cardiac bed and repeat cardiac enzymes and ECG in 6 hours",
    "D": "Begin intravenous beta-blocker therapy",
    "answer": "D",
    "exp": "The patient's history suggests acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The combination of elevated troponin and lack of ST segment elevation on ECG is most consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Initial therapy for acute coronary syndrome includes aspirin, nitroglycerin, anticoagulation, and morphine. An intravenous beta-blocker, such as metoprolol, is frequently given in the immediate management of ACS to decrease myocardial oxygen demand, limit infarct size, reduce pain, and decrease the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Elevated blood pressure also increases myocardial oxygen demand. Given this patient's increased blood pressure and continued pain, administration of a beta-blocker is the appropriate next step in his management. Administration of intravenous morphine would also be appropriate.Cardiac catheterization may well be necessary at some point during his evaluation, but there is no mortality benefit for emergent catheterization in NSTEMI. There is no role for thrombolytic therapy in patients with ACS without ST segment elevation. All patients with ACS should be admitted to a monitored cardiac unit with serial cardiac biomarkers to estimate the extent of cardiac damage, but the patient's continued pain demands urgent treatment, not just further observation. Clopidogrel therapy is indicated for patients with ACS who will not be undergoing immediate coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Clopidogrel therapy, however, will not improve this patient's elevated blood pressure nor promptly decrease myocardial oxygen demand. The correct dose of clopidogrel is a loading dose of 300 to 600 mg, then 75 mg po daily."

ECG examination provides evidence of significant myocardial infarction of the posterior wall of the left ventricle. Which of the following nerves is responsible for the radiation of pain to the arm during myocardial infarction?",
    "A": "Phrenic",
    "B": "Vagus",
    "C": "Intercostobrachial",
    "D": "Greater splanchnic",
    "answer": "C",
    "exp": "The intercostobrachial nerve is the lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve. It serves a sensory function both in the thoracic wall and medial aspect of the arm. The phrenic nerve arises from spinal nerves C3 to C5 and innervates the diaphragm. This nerve has no branches that pass into the arm. The vagus nerve is CNX and is a major supplier of autonomic function to the gut, up to the left colic flexure, and also provides some autonomic motor and sensory supply to organs in the head, neck, and thorax. The greater thoracic splanchnic nerve originates in the thorax from the sympathetic chain at the levels of T5 to T9 and innervates abdominal structures. The suprascapular nerve originates from the upper trunk of the brachial plexus and receives fibers primarily from C5 and C6. It innervates the supraspinatus and the infraspinatus."

Recommendations for infective endocarditis prophylazis have recently been changed. In symptomatic patients, some improvement usually occurs with restriction of sodium intake and small does or oral diuretics. Beta blockers, Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil or diltiazem), and digitals glycosides are useful in slowing the ventricular rate of patients with AF. Wafarin to an international normalized ratio (INR) or 2-3 should be administered indefinitely to patients with MS, who have AF or a history of thromboembolism. The routine use of warfarin in patients in sinus rhythm with LA enlargement (maximal dimension >5.5 cm) with or without spontaneous echo contras is more controversial. If AF is of relatively recent onset in a patient whose MS is not severe enough to warrant PMBV (percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy) or surgical commisurotomy, reversion to sinus rhythm pharmacologically or by means of electrical countershock is indicated. Usually, cardioversion should be undeaken after the patient has had at least 3 consective weeks of anticoagulant treatment to a therapeutic INR."

    "B": "Increases with faster ventricular rates",
    "C": "May be absent in digitalis intoxication",
    "D": "Radial pulse rate may be more than ventricular pulse rate",
    "answer": "D",
    "exp": "Answer is D (Radial pulse rate may be more than ventricular pulse rate) The radial pulse rate is always lower than the ventricular pulse rate. Pulse deficit refers to the difference between the radial pulse rate and the hea rate counted by auscultation (Apical Ventricular Rate). Pulse deficit is produced when ventricular contractions are preceded by sho diastoles such that poor ventricular filling results in insufficient stroke volume to transmit the pressure wave out to the radial pulse. The radial pulse rate is always lower than the ventricular pulse rate. Pulse Deficit in Atrial Fibrillation Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of pulse deficit (Pulse deficit has traditionally been believed to be a classical bedside sign for diagnosis of atrial fibrillation) Pulse deficit in Atrial Fibrillation is often more than 10 per minute. Pulse deficit in atrial fibrillation is greater when the ventricular rate is high Pulse deficit in atrial fibrillation may be absent in patients with slow ventricular rate (<50) If a digitalized patient with a prior diagnosis of chronic atrial fibrillation presents with a perfectly regular pulse, one should suspect digitalis intoxication with a regular nodal rhythm and atrioventricular dissociation. (Note that in this form of 'regularized' atrial fibrillation, the apical- radial pulse deficit also disappears.)"

    "D": "Pericardial effusion with tamponade",
    "answer": "A",
    "exp": "She developed bacterial septicemia followed by infective endocarditis of the mitral valve. Thus she has a high risk for developing complications of infective endocarditis. Such valvular vegetations are destructive of the valve. The impaired functioning of the mitral valve (most likely regurgitation) would give rise to left atrial dilation and left ventricular failure with pulmonary edema. Septic emboli from the mitral valve vegetation could reach the systemic circulation and give rise to abscesses. The infection of an arterial wall can weaken the wall, resulting in aneurysm formation and the potential for rupture. Dilated cardiomyopathy may be due to chronic alcoholism, or it may be idiopathic. It may be familial, or it may follow myocarditis, but it is not a direct complication of infective endocarditis. Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve results from a defect in connective tissue, whether well-defined or unknown; the mitral valve leaflets are enlarged, hooded, and redundant. Lesions on the right side of the valve can produce septic emboli that involve the lungs, but vegetations on the left side embolize to the systemic circulation, producing lesions in the spleen, kidneys, or brain. Pulmonary abscesses can occur from right-sided infective endocarditis because septic emboli pour into the pulmonary arterial circulation."

    "exp": "Mitral annular calcification is often an incidental finding on chest radiograph, echocardiography, or at autopsy. Larger accumulations of calcium in the mitral ring can impinge on the conduction system, however, causing arrhythmias or disrupting the endocardium to provide a focus for infective endocarditis and thrombus formation (which can embolize and cause a stroke, as in this patient). Some cases are associated with mitral valve prolapse. Carcinoid heart disease leads to endocardial and valvular collagenous thickening. Hyperparathyroidism can cause metastatic calcification, which usually does not involve the heart, and deposits would not be so focal; this patient does not have hypercalcemia. Infective endocarditis is a destructive process, and healing may lead to fibrosis, but not to nodular calcium deposition. The most common infiltrative cardiomyopathies are hemochromatosis and amyloidosis. Rheumatic heart disease can lead to scarring with some calcium deposition, but the valve leaflets undergo extensive scarring, with shortening and thickening of the chordae tendineae that preclude upward prolapse. Senile calcific stenosis involves the aortic valve; in this case, there is no evidence of stenosis."

    "exp": "The beneficial effects of b-blocking agents are related to their hemodynamic effects--decreased hea rate, blood pressure, and contractility--which decrease myocardial oxygen requirements at rest and during exercise. Lower hea rate is also associated with an increase in diastolic perfusion time that may increase coronary perfusion. Undesirable effects of b-blocking agents in angina include an increase in end-diastolic volume and an increase in ejection time, both of which tend to increase myocardial oxygen requirement.

    "B": "Digoxin toxicity",
    "C": "Viral gastroenteritis",
    "D": "Hypokalemia",
    "answer": "B",
    "exp": "(B) Digoxin toxicity > Digitalis is effective in patients with systolic HF complicated by atrial flutter and fibrillation and a rapid ventricular rate, who benefit both from slowing of the ventricular rate and from the positive inotropic effect.> Although digitalis does not improve survival in patients with systolic HF and sinus rhythm, it reduces symptoms of HF and the need for hospitalization.> Digitalis is of little or no value in patients with HF, sinus rhythm, and the following conditions: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, mitral stenosis, chronic constrictive pericarditis, and any form of diastolic HF.> Digoxin, which has a half-life of 1.6 days, is filtered n the glomeruli and secreted by the renal tubules. Significant reductions of the glomerular filtration rate reduce the elimination of digoxin and, therefore, may prolong digoxin's effect, allowing it to accumulate to toxic levels, unless the dose is reduced.> DIGITALIS INTOXICATION: This is a serious and potentially fatal complication. Advanced age, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypoxemia, renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, and acute myocardial infarction all may reduce tolerance to digitalis. Chronic digitalis intoxication may be insidious in onset and is characterized by anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, exacerbations of HF, weight loss, cachexia, neuralgias, gynecomastia, yellow vision, and delirium. The most frequent disturbances of cardiac rhythm are ventricular premature beats, bigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, and, rarely, ventricular fibrillation. Atrioventricular block and nonparoxysmal atrial tachycardia with variable atrioventricular block are characteristic of digitalis intoxication; withdrawal of the drug and treatment with li-adrenocepior blocker or lidocaine are indicated. If hypokalemia is present, potassium should be administered cautiously by the oral route. Fab fragments of purified, intact digitalis antibodies are a potentially lifesaving approach to the treatment of severe intoxication.> The administration of quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, and propafenone to patients receiving digoxin raises the serum concentration of the latter, increasing the propensity to digitalis intoxication.> The dose of digitalis should be reduced by half in patients receiving these drugs."

    "C": "Dysfunction from endothelial injury",
    "D": "Inhibition of LDL oxidation",
    "answer": "C",
    "exp": "Atherosclerosis is thought to result from an initial endothelial injury and the subsequent chronic inflammation and repair of the arterial intima. All risk factors, including smoking, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, cause biochemical or mechanical injury to the endothelium with resulting dysfunction that initiates smooth muscle migration with proliferation, as well as lymphocyte and monocyte-macrophage infiltration. Formation of foam cells occurs after the initial endothelial injury. Vasomotor tone does not play a major role in atherogenesis. Inhibition of LDL oxidation should diminish atheroma formation.

This rare (but often considered diagnostically) tumor is most often found in the adrenal medulla, although it can also be found in other tissues derived from neural crest cells. The tumor cells secrete catecholamine hormones or their precursors, which can cause either paroxysmal (as in this case) or persistent hypeension. Urinary metabolites of epinephrine and norepinephrine are vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid, so screening 24 hour urine collections for these substances can be helpful in establishing or excluding these diagnoses even in cases in which a physician does not observe one of the paroxysms and thus blood cannot be drawn for serum catecholamine levels at that time. DHEA is the adrenal androgen dehydroepiandrosterone (made by the adrenal coex rather than the adrenal medulla), and is measured in serum in cases where adrenal virilism is suspected. hCG is human chorionic gonadotropin, and both serum and urine levels can increase in pregnancy or trophoblastic disease. 17-ketosteroids are measured in urine during evaluation of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (a disorder of the adrenal coex rather than medulla).."

    "question": "A 59-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction 2 years ago undergoes an uneventful aoobifemoral bypass graft for aooiliac occlusive disease. Six hours later he develops ST segment depression, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) shows anterolateral ischemia. His hemodynamic parameters are as follows: systemic BP 70/40 mm Hg, pulse 100 beats per minute, CVP 18 mm Hg, PCWP 25 mm Hg, cardiac output 1.5 L/min, and systemic vascular resistance 1000 (dyne * s)/cm5 . Which of the following is the single best pharmacologic intervention for this patient?",
    "A": "Sublingual nitroglycerin",
    "B": "Intravenous nitroglycerin",
    "C": "A sho-acting b-blocker",
    "D": "Dobutamine",
    "answer": "D",
    "exp": "This patient has developed pump failure because of a combination of preexisting coronary aery occlusive disease and high preload following a fluid challenge; afterload remains moderately high as well because of systemic vasoconstriction in the presence of cardiogenic shock. Poor myocardial performance is reflected in the low cardiac output and high PCWP. Therapy must be directed at increasing cardiac output without creating too high a myocardial O2 demand on the already failing hea. Administration of nitroglycerin could be expected to reduce both preload and afterload, but, if given without an inotrope, it would create unacceptable hypotension. Nitroprusside similarly would achieve afterload reduction but would result in hypotension if not accompanied by an inotropic agent. A b-blocker would act deleteriously by reducing cardiac contractility and slowing the hea rate in a setting in which cardiac output is likely to be rate-dependent. Dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine that is becoming the inotropic agent of choice in cardiogenic shock. As a b1 -adrenergic agonist, it improves cardiac performance in pump failure both by positive inotropy and peripheral vasodilation. With minimal chronotropic effect, dobutamine only marginally increases myocardial O2 demand."

It is defined as angina pectoris or equivalent ischaemic discomfo with either one feature. 1. It occurs at rest or with minimal exeion usually lasting > 10 minutes. 2. It is severe and of new onset within the prior 4-6 weeks. 3. It has a crescendo pattern of pain - distinctly severe, prolonged and more frequent than before. Unstable angina is distinguished from non-STelevation myocardial infarction by the absence of elevated serological markers of myocardial necrosis. It is also distinguished from ST-elevation MI by the absence of persistent ST segment elevation. Pathogenesis 1. Plaque rupture or erosion with superimposed nonocclusive thrombus (most common) 2. Progressive mechanical obstruction - either rapidly advancing coronary atherosclerosis or restenosis following percutaneous coronary intervention. 3. Increased discrepancy between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. Management Immediately assess the following: * Clinical evaluation - history and physical examination * 12 - lead ECG recording * Measurement of cardiac specific markers - troponin and CK-MB. All ACS patients should be placed on aspirin, b-blocker, nitrate and clopidogrel immediately. Low risk patients - On observation if the patient remains pain-free with normal ECG and normal levels of cardiac markers, submit them for stress ECG. If the stress test is negative, consider alternative diagnosis. If the stress test is positive, continue medication and invasive testing when required. Intermediate and high risk patients - Patient has to be admitted in the intensive care unit and to be managed with anti-ischaemia, antiplatelet and anticoagulant group of drugs.

It may be preferred in diabetics receiving insulin or oral hypoglycaemics. Patients who complain of cold hands and feet while on propranolol, do better on metoprolol.\nFirst pass metabolism of metoprolol is less marked than propranolol, but 90% or more is ultimately hydroxylated by CYP2D6 before excretion. There are 'extensive' and 'poor' hydroxylators of metoprolol (CYP2D6 alleles); the latter may require a lower dose.\nSide effects of metoprolol are milder. It is generally given orally for hypertension, angina and CHF, but i.v. injection (5-15 mg) has been used in myocardial infarction provided bradycardia is absent.\nKey concept:\nBeta-blockers do not cause vasodilation.\nReference: Essentials of Medical Pharmacology Eighth Edition KD  TRIPATHI  page no 162"

Physical examination shows pallor, diaphoresis, and a murmur of aortic regurgitation. An ECG does not show myocardial infarction. An X-ray film of the chest reveals mediastinal widening. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "A": "Bacterial endocarditis",
    "B": "Dissecting aneurysm",
    "C": "Pericarditis",
    "D": "Pulmonary thromboembolism",
    "answer": "B",
    "exp": "Aortic dissection reflects hemorrhage between and along the laminar planes of the media, with the formation of a blood-filled channel within the aortic wall. If it begins in the ascending aorta, it may extend backward toward the aortic valve or distally to involve the thoracic and abdominal aorta. More than 90% of dissections occur in men between the ages of 40 and 60 with antecedent hypertension. The second major group of patients, usually younger, has a systemic or localized abnormality of connective tissue that affects the aorta (e.g., Marfan syndrome). Although bacterial endocarditis (choice A) can result in aortic regurgitation, it does not lead to acute chest pain. The other choices are not associated with aortic regurgitation.Diagnosis: Aortic dissection"

    "B": "Second week",
    "C": "Third week",
    "D": "Fouh week",
    "answer": "A",
    "exp": "Ans. A: First week The most often used markers are the creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) fraction and the troponin I (TnI) or troponin T (TnT) levels. On the basis of the ECG, a distinction is made between ST elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI). Risk Factors Older age Male sex Tobacco smoking Hypercholesterolemia (more accurately hyperlipoproteinemia, especially high low density lipoprotein and low high density lipoprotein) Hyperhomocysteinemia Diabetes (with or without insulin resistance) High blood pressure Obesity (defined by a body mass index of more than 30 kg/ m2) Stress Occupations. Women who use combined oral contraceptive pills. The most serious of these arrhythmias is ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib/VF), an extremely fast and chaotic hea rhythm that is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death. Another life threatening arrhythmia is ventricular tachycardia (V-Tach/VT). Different zones of the hea can become injured: - An occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary aery(LAD) will result in an anterior wall myocardial infarct. - Infarcts of the lateral wall are caused by occlusion of the left circumflex coronary aery(LCx) or its oblique marginal branches (or even large diagonal branches from the LAD.) Both inferior wall and posterior wall infarctions may be caused by occlusion of either the right coronary aery or the left circumflex aery, depending on which feeds the posterior descending aery. Right ventricular wall infarcts are also caused by right coronary aery occlusion. Electrocardiogram The 12 lead ECG is used to classify patients into one of three groups: Those with ST segment elevation or new bundle branch block Those with ST segment depression or T wave inversion Those with a so-called non-diagnostic or normal ECG. Complications - Congestive hea failure Myocardial rupture is most common three to five days after myocardial infarction, commonly of small degree. - Life-threatening arrhythmia-The re-entry phenomenon may cause rapid hea rates (ventricular tachycardia and even ventricular fibrillation), and ischemia in the electrical conduction system of the hea may cause a complete hea block - Pericarditis-In Dressler's syndrome, this occurs several weeks after the initial event. - Cardiogenic shock"

Creatine kinaseMB (CK-MB), myoglobin, homocysteine, C-reactive protein (CRP), troponin T (cTnT), and troponin I (cTnI) are all used for assessment of the suspected acute myocardial infarction. CK-MB, cTnT, and cTnI may also be used to identify and manage high-risk patients. Normal results vary, based on the laboratory and method used. Total CK: The values begin to rise within four to six hours and peak at 24 hours. Values return to normal within three to four days. CK-MB: The values begin to rise within two to four hours and peak at 24 hours. Values return to normal within 72 hours. Troponin T: The values begin to rise within two to four hours and peak at 48 hours. Troponin I: The values begin to rise within two to four hours and peak at 48 hours. Myoglobin: The values begin to rise within one to two hours and peak at four to eight hours. Values return to normal within 12-24 hours. Homocysteine: Moderate, intermediate, and severe hyperhomocysteinemia refer to concentrations between 16 and 30, between 31 and 100, and less than 100 micromol/ L, respectively. C-reactive protein Myoglobin is a protein found in both skeletal and myocardial muscle. It is released rapidly after tissue injury and may be elevated as early as one hour after myocardial injury, though it may also be elevated due to skeletal muscle trauma. However, if myoglobin values do not rise within three to four hours after a person shows acute symptoms, it is highly unlikely that he or she had an MI."

    "question": "A 58-year-old woman has a history of alcohol abuse, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. Her medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, simvastatin, and warfarin. She develops urinary urgency and frequency and is treated with oxycodone and ciprofloxacin. Three days later she develops a headache, dizziness, vomiting, and has difficulty walking. On neurological examination her strength, sensation (including vibratory sensation), and reflexes are normal. She walks with an uncoordinated, unsteady gait. On testing of coordination in the upper extremities, she displays past pointing and poor rapid alternating movements with her right upper extremity. In the lower extremities, her heel-shin testing also reveals poor coordination on the right. INR is 6.5 (normal <1, therapeutic for warfarin 2.0-3.0). What is the most likely cause of her neurologic findings?",
    "A": "Right cerebellar hemorrhage",
    "B": "Multiple small infarcts in the basal ganglia",
    "C": "Cerebellar degeneration due to chronic alcohol abuse",
    "D": "Posterior column degeneration as a result of vitamin deficiency",
    "answer": "A",
    "exp": "This patient has evidence of cerebellar dysfunction, most likely due to cerebellar hemorrhage. Many drugs (including ciprofloxacin) interact with warfarin, excessively prolong anticoagulation, and may result in spontaneous hemorrhage. Cerebellar lesions are typically associated with ataxia and dizziness. This patient's bleeding can be localized to the right cerebellar hemisphere since a focal lesion in one lobe of the cerebellum (e.g., a cerebellar tumor, hemorrhage or infarct) causes dyscoordination on the same side of the body (ipsilateral) as the lesion. Infarcts in the basal ganglia would cause extrapyramidal signs with rigidity and uncontrolled movements in addition to discoordination. Midline cerebellar lesions (most commonly alcoholic cerebellar degeneration) cause midline signs (especially gait ataxia) out of proportion to the findings in the extremities. Posterior column disease would cause sensory abnormalities (especially, loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation) rather than problems with coordination. Acute alcohol ingestion and narcotic overdose can cause dizziness and ataxia, often with nystagmus, but would not be expected to cause unilateral dysmetria."

These features indicate a more severe disease 'A third hea sound (S3) in chronic mitral regurgitation is usually indicative of severe regurgitation' Severity of Mitral Regurgitation: . If the murmur is harsher and has a lot of low and medium frequencies. It usually indicates a lot of flow and therefore will imply significant regurgitation. A harsh decrescendo mitral regurgitation murmur is usually indicative of severe regurgitation because the decrscendo effect is caused by early buildup of a very high v wave pressure in the left atrium resulting from a severe degree of regurgitation. Thus decreasing the gradient in late systole (If the murmur, on the other hand, is all pure high frequency and confined only to late systole. Then it must indicate a high pressure difference between the left ventricle and the left atrium and therefore only mild regurgitation). When the mitral regurgitation is severe, the volume overload on the left ventricle will be high, resulting in an enlarged left ventricle. This may be reflected in a displaced hyperdynamic wide -area left ventricular apical impulse. In addition, the hyperdynamic left ventricle will have rapid ejection. This will make the A2 occur early. Resulting in a wide-split S2. Thus, a wide -split S2 in the presence of mitral regurgitation is a sign of severe regurgitation if the wide split is not caused by P2 delay. In addition, severe regurgitation because of the volume load effect will have a torrential inflow through the mitral valve during diastole. This will set up the necessary conditions for the production of an S3 or a mid -diastolic inflow rumble. The presence of an S3 or an inflow rumble at the apex will, therefore, be a sign of significant mitral regurgitation as well. Severity of Mitral Regurgitation : Features indicating increased severity: Presence of Left ventricular S3 or an inflow rumble at the apex Harsh Decrescendo murmur with lot of low and medium frequencies Wide split S, due to early A2 (not caused by P2 delay) in presence of MR Note : Loudness and duration of Mitral regurgitation murmur does not always correlate with the severity of the regurgitation"

For the past 3 weeks, the frequency and severity of his anginal attacks have increased, and pain sometimes occurs even when he is lying in bed. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 85/min with irregular beats. An ECG shows ST-segment elevation.

    "C": "Endomyocardial fibrosis",
    "D": "Extensive myocardial fiber hypertrophy",
    "answer": "A",
    "exp": "Marked coronary artery occlusion with this degree of stenosis prevents adequate perfusion of the heart when myocardial demand is increased during exertion. He has angina on exertion and recently developed unstable angina, which is manifested by increased frequency and severity of the attacks and angina at rest. The ST-segment elevation suggests a developing acute coronary syndrome with myocardial ischemia, but the lack of cardiac enzyme elevation suggests infarction has not yet occurred. In most patients, unstable angina is induced by disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque followed by a mural thrombus and possibly distal embolization, vasospasm, or both. An acute myocardial infarction (MI) can lead to focal fibrinous pericarditis, but it is unlikely to lead to extensive scarring that surrounds the heart. Fibrosis is a late finding from the healing of infarction. Hypertrophy of the heart is unlikely to progress significantly in this case because there is neither hypertension nor a valvular lesion. Mural thrombosis may develop on the endocardial surface overlying an infarction and may fill a ventricular aneurysm following an MI. An acute MI may be complicated by papillary muscle rupture with mitral valve insufficiency."

Digitalis reduces the ventricular rate in AF by decreasing the number of impulses that are able to pass down the A-V node and bundle of His. It increases effective refractory period-ERP refractoriness) of A-V node by direct, vagomimetic and antiadrenergic action - the minimum interval between consecutive impulses that can successfully traverse the conducting tissue is increased. A degree of A-V block is naturally established in AF. Because of the relatively long ERP of A-V node, many atrial impulses impinge on it while it is still refractory; others falling early in the relative refractory period get extinguished by decremental conduction - These concealed impulses leave upper margin of A-V node refractory for a fuher period. Thus, any influence which increases atrial rate in AF (e.g. digitalis), by itself reduces ventricular rate."

    "exp": "Davidsons Principles and practice of medicine_22Edition page no 623-624 Aoic regurgitation Aetiology and pathophysiology This condition is due to disease of the aoic valve cusps or dilatation of the aoic root (Box 18.109). The LV dilates and hyperophies to compensate for the regurgitation. The stroke volume of the LV may eventually be doubled or trebled, and the major aeries are then conspicuously pulsatile. As the disease progresses, left ventricular diastolic pressure rises and breathlessness develops. Clinical features Until the onset of breathlessness, the only symptom may be an awareness of the hea beat . paicularly when lying on the left side, which results from the increased stroke volume. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea is sometimes the first symptom, and peripheral oedema or angina may occur. The characteristic murmur is best heard to the left of the sternum during held expiration. a thrill is rare. A systolic murmur due to the increased stroke volume is common and does not necessarily indicate stenosis. The regurgitant jet causes fluttering of the mitral valve and, if severe, causes paial closure of the anterior mitral leaflet, leading to functional mitral stenosis and a soft mid-diastolic (Austin Flint) murmur. In acute severe regurgitation (e.g. perforation of aoic cusp in endocarditis), there may be no time for compensatory left ventricular hyperophy and dilatation to develop and the features of hea failure may predominate. In this situation, the classical signs of aoic regurgitation may be masked by tachycardia and an abrupt rise in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure; thus, the pulse pressure may be near normal and the diastolic murmur may be sho or even absent. Investigations Regurgitation is detected by Doppler echocardiography . In severe acute aoic regurgitation, the rapid rise in left ventricular diastolic pressure may cause premature mitral valve closure. Cardiac catheterisation and aoography can help in assessing the severity of regurgitation, and dilatation of the aoa and the presence of coexisting coronary aery disease. MRI is useful in assessing the degree and extent of aoic dilatation. Management Treatment may be required for underlying conditions, such as endocarditis or syphilis. Aoic valve replacement is indicated if aoic regurgitation causes symptoms, and this may need to be combined with aoic root replacement and coronary bypass surgery. Those with chronic aoic regurgitation can remain asymptomatic for many years because compensatory ventricular dilatation and hyperophy occur, but should be advised to repo the development of any symptoms of breathlessness or angina. Asymptomatic patients should also be followed up annually with echocardiography for evidence of increasing ventricular size. If this occurs or if the end-systolic dimension increases to 55 mm or more, then aoic valve replacement should be undeaken. Systolic BP should be controlled with vasodilating drugs, such as nifedipine or ACE inhibitors. There is conflicting evidence regarding the need for aoic valve replacement in asymptomatic patients with severe aoic regurgitation. When aoic root dilatation is the cause of aoic regurgitation (e.g. Marfan's syndrome), aoic root replacement is usually necessary. <img alt=\"\" src=\" />"

    "exp": "Each of the genetic deficiencies listed may present with cardiomyopathy in childhood. LCAD affects the first step in b-oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondria. Cardiac muscle and resting skeletal muscle use fatty acids and ketones as a primary energy source, thus in LCAD deficiency, muscle weakness and eventually cardiomyopathy develop. Fasting hypoglycemia and hypoketosis occurring together are strongly suggestive of a block in fatty acid oxidation. Only a carnitine uptake deficiency (choice : Carnitine uptake deficiency) or LCAD deficiency (choice : LCAD) are related to fatty acid oxidation. Since carnitine esters (long chain acyl carnitines) are accumulating in serum and in muscle tissue, a carnitine uptake deficiency is ruled out. a-L-Iduronidase deficiency, or Hurler disease (choice : a-L-Iduronidase deficiency) is another of the lysosomal storage diseases. Cardiomyopathy, valvular defects, and potential occlusion of coronary aeries, are results of specific glycosaminoglycan (heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate) accumulation. Similar substrate accumulation in other tissues results in corneal clouding, mental retardation, and skeletal abnormalities. Hypoglycemia, hypoketosis, and muscle weakness are not prominent features of Hurler disease. There would be no accumulation of carnitine derivatives. Acid maltase is a lysosomal enzyme, and its deficiency produces one of a host of lysosomal storage diseases. Acid maltase deficiency (a 1,4-glucosidase deficiency; choice : Acid maltase deficiency) or Pompe disease is also associated with cardiomyopathy. In this case glycogen fragments accumulate in the lysosomes, primarily affecting tissues that store glycogen (muscle, liver, kidney). Hypoglycemia and hypoketosis are not features of this deficiency, nor would acyl carnitines accumulate."

    "C": "A decreased heart rate",
    "D": "An increased stroke volume",
    "answer": "B",
    "exp": "Atrial fibrillation is an arrhythmia in which the electrical activity of the atrium becomes disorganized and therefore unable to produce a coordinated atrial contraction. The absence of an atrial pulse reduces the emptying of the atria during diastole and results in an enlarged left atrium and increased left atrial pressure. The venous A wave represents atrial contraction and disappears due to the absence of an atrial beat. Decreased filling of the heart results in a decrease in stroke volume. Heart rate increases because the continuous electrical activity of the atria initiates a high rate of ventricular activity Systemic blood pressure typically falls because of inadequate filling of the ventricles and the resulting decrease in stroke volume."

    "exp": "This patient is presenting with massive pulmonary embolus with ongoing hypotension, right ventricular dysfunction, and profound hypoxemia requiring 100% oxygen.\nIn this setting, continuing with anticoagulation alone is inadequate, and the patient should receive circulatory support with fibrinolysis, if there are no contraindications to therapy.\nThe major contraindications to fibrinolysis include hypertension >180/110 mmHg, known intracranial disease or prior hemorrhagic stroke, recent surgery, or trauma.\nThe recommended fibrinolytic regimen is recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA), 100 mg IV over 2 h.\nHeparin should be continued with the fibrinolytic to prevent a rebound hypercoagulable state with dissolution of the clot.\nThere is a 10% risk of major bleeding with fibrinolytic therapy with a 1–3% risk of intracranial hemorrhage. The only indication for fibrinolysis in pulmonary embolus (PE) is for massive PE presenting with life-threatening hypotension, right ventricular dysfunction, and refractory hypoxemia.\nIn submassive PE presenting with preserved blood pressure and evidence of right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram, the decision to pursue fibrinolysis is made on a case-by-case situation. In addition to fibrinolysis, the patient should also receive circulatory support with vasopressors.\nDopamine and dobutamine are the vasopressors of choice for the treatment of shock in PE. Caution should be taken with ongoing high-volume fluid administration as a poorly functioning right ventricle may be poorly tolerant of additional fluids.\nOngoing fluids may worsen right ventricular ischemia and further dilate the right ventricle, displacing the interventricular septum to the left to worsen cardiac output and hypotension. If the patient had contraindications to fibrinolysis and was unable to be stabilized with vasopressor support, referral for surgical embolectomy should be considered.\nReferral for inferior vena cava filter placement is not indicated at this time. The patient should be stabilized hemodynamically as a first priority.\nThe indications for inferior vena cava filter placement are active bleeding, precluding anticoagulation, and recurrent deep venous thrombosis on adequate anticoagulation."

Emergency asynchronous defibrillation is required with at least 200-J monophasic/100-J biphasic shock VENTRICULAR FLUTTER AND VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION (VF) # These arrhythmias occur most often in patients with ischaemic heart disease. # Episodes of cardiac arrest recorded during Holter monitoring reveal that approximately three fourths of the sudden deaths are due to VT or VF. Types: # Ventricular flutter usually appears as a sine wave with a rate between 150 and 300 beats/min. # VF is recognized by grossly irregular undulations of varying amplitudes, contours, and rates. # VT originates below the bundle of His at a rate >100 beats per minute; most VT patients have rates >120 beats per minute. Sustained VT at rates <120 beats per minute and even <100 beats per minute can be observed, particularly in association with the administration of antiarrhythmic agents that can slow the rate. ECG Clues Supporting the Diagnosis of Ventricular Tachycardia # AV dissociation (atrial capture, fusion beats) # QRS duration >140 ms for RBBB type V1 morphology; V1>160 ms for LBBB type V1 morphology # Frontal plane axis -90Adeg to 180Adeg # Delayed activation during initial phase of the QRS complex # LBBB pattem-R wave in V1, V2>40 ms # RBBB pattern-onset of R wave to nadir of S >100 ms # Bizarre QRS pattern that does not mimic typical RBBB or LBBB QRS complex # Concordance of QRS complex in all precordial leads # RS or dominant S in V6 for RBBB VT # Q wave in V6 with LBBB QRS pattern # Monophasic R or biphasic QR or R/S in V1 with RBBB pattern TREATMENT: VENTRICULAR TACHY C ARDIA/FEBRILL ATION # Sustained polymorphic VT, ventricular flutter, and VF all lead to immediate hemodynamic collapse. Emergency asyn- chronous defibrillation is therefore required, with at least 200-J monophasic or 100-J biphasic shock. The shock should be delivered asynchronously to avoid delays related to sensing of the QRS complex. If the arrhythmia persists, repeated shocks with the maximum energy output of the defibrillator are essential to optimize the chance of successful resuscitation. Intravenous lidocaine and/or amiodarone should be administered but should not delay repeated attempts at defibrillation. # For any monomorphic wide complex rhythm that results in hemodynamic compromise, a prompt R-wave synchronous shock is required. Pharmacologic treatment to terminate monomorphic VT is not typically successful (<30%). Intravenous procainamide, lidocaine, or amiodarone can be utilized. Idiopathic LV septal VT appears to respond uniquely to IV verapamil administration. # VT in patients with structural heart disease is now almost always treated with the implantation of an ICD to manage anticipated VT recurrence. The ICD can provide rapid pacing and shock therapy to treat most VTs effectively # Several recent secondary prevention trials have demonstrated superior survival (3 years) in patients treated with ICDs versus amiodarone ALGORITHM: VF | | Assess ABC | | Give pericardial thump and begin CPR till defibrillator is ready | | Defibrillation with 200 J (2 J/kg in children) and repeat with 300 and 360 j (4 J/kg in children) | | Rhythm after first 3 shocks | | | | Asystole Normal rhythm VF still persists | | Intubate at once, obtain IV access and give adrenaline 1 mg IV and defibrillate with 360 J. | | If not aborted, repeat adrenaline in high dose and defibrillate with 360 J. | | If not aborted, give lignocaine/ bretyl ium/MgSO4/NaHCO3 with D-360 J. | | If no response, terminate efforts."

It is now known that the predominant mechanism for atrial flutter is right atrial macro reentry with circular activation. Atrial flutter typically originates from the right atrium and most often involves a large circuit that travels around the area of the tricuspid valve.

The main indications for digoxin in atrial fibrillation are restoration of sinus rhythm, prevention of recurrence and slowing of the ventricular rate Other common dysrhythmias associated with digoxin toxicity include: Frequent PVCs (the most common abnormality), including ventricular bigeminy and trigeminy. Regularised AF = AF with complete hea block and a junctional or ventricular escape rhythm. Ventricular tachycardia, including polymorphic and bidirectional VT Adenosine can, at times, terminate the rhythm, but not always. Ablation of atrial tachycardia is also an option, especially when medical therapy fails. Special Situations: Atrial tachycardia with 2:1 block; when atrial tachycardia occurs with a 2:1 conduction block digoxin is best and toxicity should be considered Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 460"

    "question": "A female infant is born approximately 10 weeks prematurely (at 30 weeks) and weighs 1710 gm. She has respiratory distress syndrome and is treated with endogenous surfactant. She is intubated endotracheally with mechanical ventilation immediately after bih. Over the first 4 days after bih the ventilator pressure and the fraction of inspired oxygen are reduced. Beginning on the fifth day after bih, she has brief desaturations that become more persistent. She needs increased ventilator and oxygen suppo on the seventh day after bih. She becomes cyanotic. Fuher examination, echocardiogram, and x-rays reveal left atrial enlargement, an enlarged pulmonary aery, increased pulmonary vasculature, and a continuous machine-like murmur. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "A": "Persistent foramen ovale",
    "B": "Patent ductus aeriosus",
    "C": "Ventricular septal defect",
    "D": "Pulmonary stenosis",
    "answer": "B",
    "exp": "Patent ductus aeriosus. The presence of a murmur could be indicative of any of the conditions. The presence of a continuous machine-like murmur is indicative of a patent ductus aeriosus (PDA). Usually, as in this case, the premature baby with PDA does not acutely become cyanotic and ill, although brief desaturations can occur that become more persistent. An atrial septal defect (ASD), such as a persistent foramen ovale, could be eliminated from the diagnosis because the murmur would be heard as an abnormal splitting of the second sound during expiration (answer a). A patent foramen ovale is a common echo finding in premature babies and is usually not followed up unless it appears remarkable to the pediatric cardiologist or there is a persistent murmur. A patent foramen ovale might result in only minimal or intermittent cyanosis during crying or straining to pass stool. A murmur caused by a ventricular septal defect (VSD, answer c), occurs between the first and second hea sounds (S1and S2) and is described as holosystolic (pansystolic) because the amplitude is high throughout systole. Pulmonary stenosis would be heard as a harsh systolic ejection murmur (answer d). PDA refers to the maintenance of the ductus aeriosus, a normal fetal structure. In the fetus, the ductus aeriosus allows blood to bypass the pulmonary circulation, since the lungs are not involved in CO2/O2exchange until after bih. The placenta subserves the function of gas exchange during fetal development. The ductus aeriosus shunts flow from the left pulmonary aery to the aoa. High oxygen levels after bih and the absence of prostaglandins from the placenta cause the ductus aeriosus to close in most cases within 24 hours. A PDA most often corrects itself within several months of bih, but may require infusion of indomethacin (a prostaglandin inhibitor) as a treatment, inseion of surgical plugs during catheterization, or actual surgical ligation."

    "question": "A 70-year-old diabetic and hypeensive patient was being investigated for angina and a coronary angiogram was performed. Two days later, he developed fever and abdominal discomfo and dyspnea and a mottled skin rash. His great toe appeared black. His BP increased to 180/100. His creatinine was found to have risen from a pre-angiography level of 1.2 to 3.6 mg/dl. He has eosinophilia. Which one of the following statements is TRUE regarding this condition?",

    "C": "Heparin is the treatment of choice",
    "D": "Kidney biopsy will show micro-vessel occlusion with a cleft in the vessel",
    "answer": "D",
    "exp": "Diabetes and angina both point to atherosclerosis. In patients undergoing angiography, catheterization can lead to embolism of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque in descending aoa downstream to renal aeries leading to an atheroembolic kidney disease. The symptoms of diabetic patient developed after angiography and since atherosclerotic lesion can involve the aoa, the atheroembolic event would explain the events. Presence of eosinophilia and mottling of toes and reduced kidney function confirm the diagnosis as Atheroembolic kidney disease. Hence Choice D is the answer. Lab findings include Rising serum creatinine Transient eosinophilia Elevated sedimentation rate Hypocomplementemia Definitive diagnosis by doing kidney biopsy:- Microvessel obstruction with cholesterol crystals that leave a cleft in the vessel. Contrast-induced nephropathy can occur in diabetics with chronic kidney disease. However rash, toe discoloration with the sudden rise of creatinine and eosinophilia are not seen in contrast-induced nephropathy. Hence choice B is ruled out Choice A is ruled out as it prevents contrast-induced nephropathy Choice C is ruled as out as heparin will not manage cholesterol embolism"

    "question": "An 80-year-old woman is admitted to the intensive care unit with sepsis due to a urinary tract infection. While in the ICU she develops atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is treated with a loading dose of amiodarone. She converts to sinus rhythm and is sent home on amiodarone to prevent recurrences of atrial fibrillation. In the following weeks she develops increasing fatigue, dry skin, and constipation and her internist finds her TSH to be 25. She is in sinus rhythm. What is the best approach in this situation?",
    "A": "Stop the amiodarone and follow the TSH and the clinical response.",
    "B": "Start low dose levothyroxine and repeat TSH in 6 weeks.",
    "C": "Start a beta-blocker and begin weaning off the amiodarone.",
    "D": "Check for anti-TPO antibodies to help guide your decision.",
    "answer": "B",
    "exp": "Amiodarone is a widely used antiarrhythmic drug. It is related structurally to thyroid hormone and is stored in adipose tissue. The drug has a high iodine content as well. Taking amiodarone on an ongoing basis can lead to hypothyroidism by inhibiting deiodinase activity and by acting as a direct antagonist to T4 . In some cases, amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism resolves within a few months; however, in many, especially when accompanying anti-TPO antibodies are present, treatment with levothyroxine is needed. This can be easily monitored and adjusted. While answer a is a consideration, the patient likely needs the amiodarone given her tendency toward paroxysms of atrial fibrillation and the attendant risk of stroke. While starting a beta-blocker may prevent episodes of rapid ventricular response, this decision would be made with the help of her cardiologist, which is not mentioned. Anti-TPO antibodies increase the risk of hypothyroidism but are not necessary to guide therapy in this patient. Although prednisone may be used for treatment of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism, this patient has hypothyroidism, and prednisone is not indicated."

TTE is the standard test for the noninvasive evaluation of pericardial disease. Identification of vegetations on tricuspid valves is no better overall by TEE than by TEE (as the tricuspid valve is equidistant from the chest wall and the esophagus). Very anterior masses, Such as left ventricular apical thrombi, are equally well and, far more easily imaged by TTE. Trans-esophageal echocardiogram (TEE) vs. Trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) Trans-esophageal Echocardiography (TEE) is generally more sensitive than Trans-thoracic Echocardiography (TTE) and provides a unique window for high resolution imaging of posterior structures of the hea paicularly the left atrium, mitral valve and aoa. TEE is however an invasive and more expensive procedure and hence its indications must be weighed against these factors and TTE remains the initial investigation of choice for most situations. However if a high clinical index of suspicion remains after a negative or non-diagnostic transthoracic study, Trans-esophageal echocardiography should be considered. Situations in which Trans-esophageal echocardiography should be performed as the initial test of choice include Those patients in whom image quality on chest wall imaging is unacceptable.

    "answer": "B",
    "exp": "Aim for the treatment of classical angina is decrease in work of hea. It can be accomplished by decrease in preload, decrease in afterload or decrease in hea rate. Nitrates act by production of nitric oxide (NO). NO stimulates guanylate cyclase in smooth muscles which leads to formation of cGMP. Later acts on smooth muscles to cause vasodilation. Nitrates mainly produce NO in veins leading to its predominant action as venodilation. Dilation of veins results in decrease in pre-load. Therefore major mechanism of action of nitrates in angina is decrease in preload. However, in variant angina these drugs benefit by causing coronary vasodilation as variant angina occurs due to vasospasm of coronary aery."

It is located under the cerebral hemispheres and drains the anterior and central regions of the brain into the sinuses of the posterior cerebral fossa .\nVGM results from an aneurysmal malformation with an arteriovenous shunting of blood.VGM usually causes high-output heart failure in the newborn resulting from the decreased resistance and high blood flow in the lesion.\nAssociated findings include cerebral ischemic changes such as strokes or steal phenomena that result in progressive hemiparesis.\nThe malformation may result in mass effects, causing progressive neurological impairment. Alternatively, the malformation may cause obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow and result in hydrocephalus.\nLoud intracranial bruit may be heard because of the blood turbulence in VGM.\nThe most effective treatment for the malformation has been embolization rather than surgery \nThe vein of Galen abnormality is the most frequent arteriovenous malformation in neonates."
