Common hepatic artery -> Celiac trunk -> Left gastric artery\n4. Common hepatic artery -> Splenic artery -> Short gastric arteries\n\n**Reasoning Process:**\n\n1. **Understanding the anatomy:**\n   - The common hepatic artery is a major branch of the celiac trunk, which supplies blood to the liver, stomach, and other abdominal organs.\n   - The common hepatic artery gives rise to the gastroduodenal artery, which further branches into the right gastroepiploic artery and the right gastric artery.\n\n2. **Impact of ligation:**\n   - Ligation of the common hepatic artery would directly affect the blood flow through its branches.\n   - The gastroduodenal artery, a branch of the common hepatic artery, would have reduced blood flow, affecting its subsequent branches, including the right gastroepiploic artery and the right gastric artery.\n\n3. **Assessing the branches:**\n   - The right gastroepiploic artery, which supplies the greater curvature of the stomach, arises from the gastroduodenal artery. Therefore, its blood supply would be compromised.\n   - The right gastric artery, which supplies the lesser curvature of the stomach, also arises from the gastroduodenal artery, and its blood supply would be compromised as well.\n\n4. **Other arteries:**\n   - The left gastric artery arises directly from the celiac trunk, not the common hepatic artery, so its blood supply would not be directly affected by the ligation of the common hepatic artery.\n   - The short gastric arteries arise from the splenic artery, which is another branch of the celiac trunk, and would not be directly affected by the ligation of the common hepatic artery.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLigation of the common hepatic artery will compromise the blood flow to the right gastric and right gastroepiploic arteries, as they are branches of the gastroduodenal artery, which arises from the common hepatic artery. The left gastric artery and short gastric arteries will not be directly affected by this ligation.\n\n=== Entry 5 ===\nquestion: Typhoid investigation of choice in 1st week\nA: Blood culture\nB: Widal test\nC: Stool culture\nD: Urine culture\nanswer: A\nexp: Finding reasoning paths:\n\n1.

Evaluate the diagnostic methods available for typhoid fever and their effectiveness in the early stages of the disease.\n3. Analyze the sensitivity and specificity of blood cultures in detecting Salmonella typhi during the first week of infection.\n4. Compare blood culture with other diagnostic methods such as serological tests or stool cultures in terms of timing and accuracy.\n\nReasoning Process:\n\n1. **Pathophysiology of Typhoid Fever**: Typhoid fever is caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhi. In the early stages of infection, the bacteria enter the bloodstream, leading to bacteremia. This is why blood cultures are often considered in the initial diagnostic approach.\n\n2. **Diagnostic Methods**: Various methods can be used to diagnose typhoid fever, including blood cultures, serological tests (such as the Widal test), and stool cultures. Each method has its own timing and accuracy considerations.\n\n3. **Blood Culture Sensitivity and Specificity**: Blood cultures are known to be highly sensitive in the first week of typhoid fever, with a positivity rate of approximately 90%. This high sensitivity makes it a reliable method for early diagnosis when the bacteria are present in the bloodstream.\n\n4. **Comparison with Other Methods**: Serological tests like the Widal test are less reliable in the first week because they depend on the body's immune response, which may not be fully developed. Stool cultures may not be positive until later in the disease course when the bacteria are shed in the feces.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBlood culture is the preferred method for diagnosing typhoid fever in the first week due to its high sensitivity and ability to detect the presence of Salmonella typhi in the bloodstream during the early stages of infection.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# 定义关键词（可根据需要扩展）\nkeywords =  [\n    # 冠心病\n    'coronary artery disease', 'CAD', 'angina', 'stable angina', 'unstable angina',\n    'myocardial infarction', 'MI', 'heart attack', 'NSTEMI', 'STEMI',\n    'acute coronary syndrome', 'ACS', 'ischemic heart disease', 'IHD',\n\n    # 心律失常\n    'arrhythmia', 'atrial fibrillation', 'ventricular tachycardia',\n    'ventricular fibrillation', 'bundle branch block', 'heart block',\n\n    # 心力衰竭\n    'heart failure', 'congestive heart failure', 'CHF',\n    'left ventricular dysfunction', 'right heart failure',\n    'ejection fraction', 'reduced EF', 'cardiomyopathy',\n    'dilated cardiomyopathy', 'hypertrophic cardiomyopathy',\n\n    # 心瓣膜病 / 杂音\n    'valvular heart disease', 'aortic stenosis', 'mitral regurgitation',\n    'heart murmur', 'valve prolapse', 'bicuspid aortic valve',\n    'echocardiogram'\n]\n\n# 转小写进行匹配\ndef is_cardiovascular_related(text):\n    if text is None:\n        return False\n    text = text.lower()\n    return any(kw in text for kw in keywords)\n    \n# 过滤符合条件的记录\ncardio_questions = [\n    item for item in extracted_data\n    if is_cardiovascular_related(item.get('question'))\n]\n\nprint(f\"Found {len(cardio_questions)} cardiovascular-related entries.\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-22T08:04:54.832863Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-22T08:04:54.833142Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-22T08:04:55.304155Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-22T08:04:54.833114Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-22T08:04:55.303191Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Found 1225 cardiovascular-related entries.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":7},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for i, item in enumerate(cardio_questions[:5], 1):\n    print(f\"\\n=== Cardiovascular Entry {i} ===\")\n    for key in ['question', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'answer', 'exp']:\n        print(f\"{key}: {item.get(key)}\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-22T08:05:25.792416Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-22T08:05:25.792721Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-22T08:05:25.799170Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-22T08:05:25.792694Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-22T08:05:25.798078Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\n=== Cardiovascular Entry 1 ===\nquestion: Which of the following drugs is used for the prophylaxis of migraine but not for angina pectoris\nA: Verapamnil\nB: Diltiazem\nC: Flunarizine\nD: Amlodipine\nanswer: C\nexp: **Finding reasoning paths:**\n\n1.

This could be due to regulatory decisions, lack of approval, or market considerations in these countries.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFlunarizine is used for the prophylaxis of migraine disorders due to its calcium channel blocking activity. It is not used for angina pectoris, and it is not available by prescription in the United States or Japan.\n\n=== Cardiovascular Entry 2 ===\nquestion: Which of the following flipped pattern of LDH is seen in myocardial infarction:\nA: LDH 1>2\nB: LDH 2> 1\nC: LDH 3>4\nD: LDH 5> 4\nanswer: A\nexp: Finding reasoning paths:\n\n1. Blood -> LDH-1 and LDH-2 -> Lactate dehydrogenase activity -> Myocardial infarction\n2. Blood -> LDH-1 and LDH-2 -> Lactate dehydrogenase activity -> Hemolytic anemia\n\nReasoning Process:\n\n1. **Understanding LDH Isoenzymes**: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme that exists in different isoenzymes, primarily LDH-1 and LDH-2. In normal conditions, LDH-2 is more prevalent in the blood than LDH-1.\n\n2. **LDH in Myocardial Infarction**: During a myocardial infarction (heart attack), heart muscle cells are damaged, releasing their contents into the bloodstream. Heart muscle cells are rich in LDH-1, leading to an increase in LDH-1 levels in the blood. This results in a \"flipped\" pattern where LDH-1 becomes greater than LDH-2, which is a diagnostic marker for myocardial infarction.\n\n3. **LDH in Hemolytic Anemia**: In hemolytic anemia, there is increased destruction of red blood cells, which also contain LDH. However, the pattern typically involves an increase in LDH-2 rather than LDH-1, as red blood cells have a different isoenzyme distribution compared to heart muscle cells.\n\n4. **Differentiating Conditions**: The key difference between myocardial infarction and hemolytic anemia in terms of LDH patterns is the predominance of LDH-1 in myocardial infarction versus LDH-2 in hemolytic anemia. This distinction helps in diagnosing myocardial infarction when the flipped pattern is observed.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe flipped pattern of LDH seen in myocardial infarction is characterized by LDH-1 being greater than LDH-2. This pattern is a result of the release of LDH-1 from damaged heart muscle cells, distinguishing it from conditions like hemolytic anemia, where LDH-2 is more elevated.\n\n=== Cardiovascular Entry 3 ===\nquestion: In a patient with chronic atrial fibrillation with a regular beat of 60/min , the most probable cause is -\nA: Sleep\nB: Digitalis toxicity\nC: Sino nodal block\nD: Hypothyroidism\nanswer: B\nexp: **Finding reasoning paths:**\n\n1. Chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) -> Treatment with Digoxin -> Digitalis toxicity -> Regular beat.\n2. Chronic atrial fibrillation -> AV node dysfunction -> Regular beat.\n3. Chronic atrial fibrillation -> Medication side effects -> Regular beat.\n\n**Reasoning Process:**\n\n1. **Chronic Atrial Fibrillation and Treatment:**\n   - Patients with chronic atrial fibrillation often receive medications to control heart rate and rhythm. Digoxin is a common medication used for rate control in AF.\n   - Digoxin can lead to Digitalis toxicity, especially if the patient has renal impairment or is on interacting medications.\n\n2. **Digitalis Toxicity:**\n   - Digitalis toxicity can cause various arrhythmias, including regularization of the heart rate due to AV block or junctional rhythms.\n   - A regular beat of 60/min could suggest a junctional rhythm or complete heart block, both of which can be associated with Digitalis toxicity.\n\n3. **AV Node Dysfunction:**\n   - In patients with AF, if there is an underlying AV node dysfunction, it could lead to a regular ventricular response.\n   - However, this is less common without an external factor like medication influencing the conduction system.\n\n4. **Medication Side Effects:**\n   - Other medications used in AF, such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, can also cause a regular heart rate by affecting the AV node.\n   - However, these typically do not cause a regular beat of exactly 60/min unless there is a specific dosing or toxicity issue.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most probable cause of a regular beat of 60/min in a patient with chronic atrial fibrillation is Digitalis toxicity due to the use of Digoxin. This is because Digoxin can cause AV block or junctional rhythms, leading to a regular heart rate.\n\n=== Cardiovascular Entry 4 ===\nquestion: The treatment of acute myocardial infarction includes which of the following-\nA: Aspirin\nB: Heparin\nC: Alteplase\nD: Oral anticoagulants\nanswer: A\nexp: Finding reasoning paths:\n1. Acute myocardial infarction -> Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) administration\n2. Acute myocardial infarction -> Pain relief and prevention of complications\n3. ST-elevation myocardial infarction -> Reperfusion therapy -> Aspirin administration\n4. Fibrinolysis -> Myocardial infarction -> Aspirin administration\n\nReasoning Process:\n1. **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and Initial Treatment**: When a patient presents with an acute myocardial infarction, the immediate goal is to restore blood flow to the heart muscle to minimize damage. This involves identifying candidates for reperfusion therapy, which can be achieved through primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolysis. Aspirin is a critical component of initial treatment because it inhibits platelet aggregation, reducing the risk of further clot formation and helping to maintain blood flow.\n\n2. **Role of Aspirin**: Aspirin, or acetylsalicylic acid, is recommended as an initial treatment for AMI due to its antiplatelet effects. It helps prevent the enlargement of the thrombus (blood clot) that is occluding the coronary artery, thereby reducing the risk of further ischemic events. It is typically administered immediately unless contraindicated by an allergy or intolerance.\n\n3. **Pain Relief and Prevention of Complications**: In addition to reperfusion therapy, managing pain and preventing complications such as arrhythmias are crucial. Aspirin contributes to these goals by reducing the inflammatory response and stabilizing the coronary plaque.\n\n4. **ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) and Reperfusion Therapy**: In cases of STEMI, rapid reperfusion is essential. Aspirin is part of the standard treatment protocol, often administered alongside other medications like heparin or fibrinolytics, depending on the availability of PCI and the patient's condition.\n\n5. **Fibrinolysis and Aspirin**: If PCI is not available, fibrinolysis is considered. Aspirin is used in conjunction with fibrinolytic agents to enhance the overall effectiveness of the treatment by preventing new clot formation.\n\nConclusion:\nAspirin is recommended as an initial treatment for acute myocardial infarction to prevent further clot formation and reduce complications. It is a key component of the therapeutic strategy for managing AMI, particularly in the context of reperfusion therapy.\n\n=== Cardiovascular Entry 5 ===\nquestion: Which one of the following congenital heart diseases has cyanosis without cardiomegaly and/or congestive heart failure –\nA: Transposition of great arteries\nB: Fallot's tetralogy\nC: Congenital mitral regurgitaion\nD: Congenital pulmonary stenosis\nanswer: B\nexp: Finding reasoning paths:\n\n1. Congenital heart disease -> Tetralogy of Fallot -> Cyanosis without cardiomegaly or congestive heart failure.\n2. Congenital heart disease -> Tricuspid atresia -> Cyanosis with potential cardiomegaly or congestive heart failure.\n3. Congenital heart disease -> Left ventricular noncompaction -> Congestive heart failure.\n4. Congenital heart disease -> Long QT syndrome -> Congestive heart failure.\n\nReasoning Process:\n\n1. **Understanding the Question**: The question asks which congenital heart disease presents with cyanosis but without cardiomegaly or congestive heart failure. Cyanosis is a bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen levels in the blood, often seen in congenital heart diseases with right-to-left shunts.\n\n2. **Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)**: This condition is characterized by four defects: ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta. The pulmonary stenosis causes a right-to-left shunt through the VSD, leading to cyanosis. The right ventricular hypertrophy is typically concentric, meaning the heart muscle thickens without dilating, which prevents cardiomegaly. The VSD allows blood to bypass the lungs, preventing congestive heart failure.\n\n3. **Tricuspid Atresia**: This condition involves the absence of a tricuspid valve, leading to underdevelopment of the right ventricle. It often results in cyanosis due to mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. However, it can lead to cardiomegaly and congestive heart failure due to increased pressure and volume load on the left heart.\n\n4. **Left Ventricular Noncompaction**: This is a rare cardiomyopathy that can lead to heart failure due to poor heart muscle function. It is not typically associated with cyanosis without heart failure.\n\n5. **Long QT Syndrome**: This is a condition affecting the heart's electrical system, leading to arrhythmias. It is not typically associated with cyanosis or structural heart defects like cardiomegaly.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBased on the reasoning, Tetralogy of Fallot is the congenital heart disease that presents with cyanosis without cardiomegaly or congestive heart failure. The combination of pulmonary stenosis and VSD in TOF allows for cyanosis without the heart enlargement or failure seen in other conditions.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import json\n\noutput_path = '/kaggle/working/UCSC_cardio.json'\n\nwith open(output_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    json.dump(cardio_questions, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)\n\nprint(f\"Exported {len(cardio_questions)} cardiovascular questions to {output_path}\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-22T08:06:12.994741Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-22T08:06:12.995599Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-22T08:06:13.068659Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-22T08:06:12.995562Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-22T08:06:13.067743Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Exported 1225 cardiovascular questions to /kaggle/working/UCSC_cardio.json\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":10}]}
